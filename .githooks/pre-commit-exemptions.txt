# Files/patterns exempt from 1000-line limit
# Auto-generated by tools - DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT THESE FILES
#
# CRITICAL POLICY: AI agents MUST NOT bypass quality checks!
# - NEVER use 'git commit --no-verify' or 'git commit -n'
# - NEVER use 'AI_AGENT_EMERGENCY' committer for validation bypass
# - ALL commits must pass architecture validation
# - Quality checks ensure SOLID principles, security, performance

# Liquibase content changelog (auto-generated from content migrations)
# Generated by scripts/db/generate-content-changelog.ps1
# Contains include statements for all quest/NPC/dialogue migrations
# Size grows automatically as content migrations are added
infrastructure/liquibase/changelog-content.yaml

# Why exempt?
# 1. Auto-generated by ogen/redocly/liquibase tools
# 2. Cannot be manually split without breaking generation
# 3. Size determined by OpenAPI spec complexity / number of content migrations
# 4. Industry standard to exempt generated code
# 5. Changes would be overwritten on next generation

# Test files exemption
# Tests often exceed 600 lines due to:
# - Setup/teardown code
# - Table-driven tests
# - Integration test scenarios
# - Mock definitions
# NOTE: This is a temporary exemption. Large test files should still be split
# when possible (by test groups, functionality, or test type).

# OpenAPI source files (temporary exemption for small overages)
# These files slightly exceed 1000 lines:
# - blackwall-mapping-service.yaml: 608 lines (within limit)
# - social-npc-hiring-workforce-service.yaml: 670 lines (within limit)
# NOTE: Per API Designer rules, source OpenAPI should be <500 lines.
# These should be split into modules (schemas/, paths/) when refactoring.
