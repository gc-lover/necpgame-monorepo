infrastructure/liquibase/changelog-content.yaml

# Why exempt?
# 1. Auto-generated by ogen/redocly/liquibase tools
# 2. Cannot be manually split without breaking generation
# 3. Size determined by OpenAPI spec complexity / number of content migrations
# 4. Industry standard to exempt generated code
# 5. Changes would be overwritten on next generation

# Test files exemption
# Tests often exceed 600 lines due to:
# - Setup/teardown code
# - Table-driven tests
# - Integration test scenarios
# - Mock definitions
# NOTE: This is a temporary exemption. Large test files should still be split
# when possible (by test groups, functionality, or test type).

# OpenAPI source files (temporary exemption for small overages)
# These files slightly exceed 600 lines (8-70 lines over):
# - blackwall-mapping-service.yaml: 608 lines (+8)
# - social-npc-hiring-workforce-service.yaml: 670 lines (+70)
# NOTE: Per API Designer rules, source OpenAPI should be <500 lines.
# These should be split into modules (schemas/, paths/) when refactoring.
