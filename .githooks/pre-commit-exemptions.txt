# redocly bundled OpenAPI specs (auto-generated from split specs)

# Why exempt?
# 1. Auto-generated by ogen/redocly tools
# 2. Cannot be manually split without breaking generation
# 3. Size determined by OpenAPI spec complexity
# 4. Industry standard to exempt generated code
# 5. Changes would be overwritten on next generation

# TODO: Split these test files later
