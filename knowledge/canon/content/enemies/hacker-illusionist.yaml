# Lore and backstory
lore:
  background: |
    Known only as "The Phantom", this rogue hacker was once a Militech network
    specialist who went AWOL after discovering corporate secrets too dangerous
    to contain. Now operating as a freelance digital saboteur, Phantom uses
    advanced neural implants and custom signal manipulation software to turn
    the battlefield into a hall of mirrors.

    His cyberware allows him to interface directly with local networks, creating
    sophisticated illusions that confuse both human senses and targeting systems.
    He views combat as a digital chess game where information is the ultimate weapon.

  personality: |
    The Phantom is a methodical manipulator who takes pleasure in psychological
    warfare. He speaks in cryptic, tech-laden riddles and enjoys toying with
    his victims before delivering the killing blow. Despite his electronic
    demeanor, he displays human emotions like frustration when illusions fail
    and satisfaction when deception succeeds.

    He maintains a database of player behavioral patterns, adapting his tactics
    to exploit individual weaknesses in perception and decision-making.

  combat_philosophy: |
    "Reality is just data. And data can be rewritten."
