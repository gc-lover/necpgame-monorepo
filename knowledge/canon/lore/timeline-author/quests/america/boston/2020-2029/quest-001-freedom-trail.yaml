      description: |
        Player hired Marcus Revere investigate PatriotTech AR implants Freedom Trail.
        Marcus demonstrates implant during tour - enhanced historical recreations
        impressive (Battle Bunker Hill holographic, Paul Revere's ride immersive),
        но biometric data constantly transmitted (eye tracking, heart rate, emotional
        microexpressions). Marcus hacked implant discovered data sold advertising
        agencies, political campaigns, government surveillance programs. Evidence
        gathered: Corporate contracts leaked, visitor data profiles anonymized inadequately,
        internal memos admit surveillance primary revenue.
        
        Player tasks:
        1. Walk Freedom Trail wearing hacked implant (record data collection invasiveness)
        2. Interview tourists (aware surveillance? Consented? Care?)
        3. Meet Marcus Old North Church (evidence reviewed, options discussed)
        
        Outcome: Player understands scope surveillance, moral stakes clear, choices
        presented.
      
      key_locations:
        - Boston Common (starting point, PatriotTech kiosk AR implants distributed)
        - Massachusetts State House (landmark 1, holographic revolutionary speeches,
          emotional response tracked)
        - Old North Church (landmark 8, Marcus hideout, evidence cache hidden)
      
      npcs:
        - Marcus Revere (quest giver, passionate historian, moral anchor)
        - Tourists various (reactions surveillance range oblivious outraged)
        - PatriotTech staff (corporate friendly evasive questions)
      
      choices:
        - Accept investigation (proceed quest)
        - Refuse involvement (quest ends, payment small, guilt possible)
        - Report Marcus authorities (betray immediately, corporate rewards, reputation
          damaged activists)
    
    section_2_sides:
      title: Шоны свободы / Sons of Liberty
      description: |
        Marcus introduces player Veronica Flag, Sons Liberty 2.0 leader. Veronica
        planning coordinated sabotage PatriotTech infrastructure - EMP devices disable
        AR servers, data centers physical attacked, CEO Noah Patent targeted intimidation
        violence. Veronica passionate convincing - corporatism cancer American values,
        legal channels failed decades, direct action only language understands. Player
        offered role: Inside saboteur (plant EMP devices landmarks), getaway driver
        (extract team after attacks), hacker (data deletion corporate servers).
        
        Simultaneously, player contacted Dr. Noah Patent directly - PatriotTech aware
        investigation (surveillance noticed Marcus), offers counter-proposition: Infiltrate
        Sons Liberty, provide intelligence prevent terrorism, compensation generous
        legal immunity guaranteed. Patent argues patriots genuine (technology enhances
        education funding preservation), sabotage threatens tourists harms Boston
        economy, Sons Liberty extremists hijacking legitimate concerns.
        
        Player choice critical:
        - Side Marcus/Veronica (idealism justice corporate exploitation unacceptable)
        - Side Dr. Patent (pragmatism terrorism worse surveillance, tourists endangered)
        - Remain neutral (gather evidence expose both, legal authorities involved)
        - Exploit chaos (sell intelligence highest bidder profit maximized)
      
      key_locations:
        - Faneuil Hall (Sons Liberty meeting place, recruitment speeches, planning
          sabotage)
        - PatriotTech headquarters (Seaport District, corporate luxury, surveillance
          control center)
        - Paul Revere House (Marcus sentimental attachment, neutral meeting ground
          proposed)
      
      npcs:
        - Veronica Flag (charismatic militant, recruits player, methods escalate)
        - Dr. Noah Patent (corporate smooth, manipulates player, sincerity questionable)
        - Marcus Revere (torn violence uncomfortable corporate evil clear, player's
          conscience)
      
      choices:
        - Join Sons Liberty sabotage (violence direct action justified resistance)
        - Infiltrate Sons for PatriotTech (pragmatism terrorism prevented tourists
          safe)
        - Propose compromise (negotiate Marcus Patent regulated surveillance transparency)
        - Expose both publicly (journalism legal channels moral high ground maintained)
        - Betray everyone profit (sell information multiple parties eddies maximized)

      description: |
        Final confrontation Freedom Trail anniversary night Paul Revere's ride -
        tourists thousands gathered, media coverage extensive, symbolic stakes high.
        Player's choice section 2 determines outcome:
        
        **Sabotage Path:** Player assists Sons Liberty EMP attack PatriotTech servers
        AR implants mass malfunction, tourists panic confusion, data centers disabled
        evidence erased partially. CEO Patent confronted publicly Marcus Veronica
        accusations broadcast, corporate reputation damaged, legal investigations
        launched. Outcome: PatriotTech withdraws Boston temporarily, Sons Liberty
        heroes martyrs (arrests possible), historical sites protected violence legacy
        complicated.
        
        **Corporate Path:** Player infiltrates Sons provides intelligence, FBI raids
        meeting arrests leadership including Veronica, Marcus escapes disillusionment
        profound. PatriotTech continues operations surveillance expanded "security
        measures," public unaware data harvesting, player compensated guilty possibly.
        Outcome: Terrorism prevented tourists safe, corporate surveillance normalized,
        resistance crushed temporarily, player complicit questioned.
        
        **Compromise Path:** Player negotiates Marcus Patent mediation - PatriotTech
        agrees regulated surveillance (data anonymized genuinely, opt-in explicit,
        transparency reports published), historical sites council established (local
        oversight corporate tech), Sons Liberty stands down violence avoided. Outcome:
        Imperfect balance achieved, surveillance reduced not eliminated, historical
        integrity partially preserved, player pragmatism rewarded principles compromised.
        
        **Exposure Path:** Player gathers evidence PatriotTech surveillance Sons Liberty
        violence plans, submits journalism outlets legal authorities simultaneously.
        Media scandal erupts - PatriotTech contracts canceled investigated, Sons Liberty
        leadership arrested sympathy public minimal, Freedom Trail placed temporary
        moratorium pending review. Outcome: Justice served both sides accountable,
        player reputation hero journalists, historical sites protected indefinitely,
        corporate dystopia resisted successfully.
        
        **Profit Path:** Player sells intelligence PatriotTech, Sons Liberty, competitor
        corporations, media outlets - chaos maximized eddies collected. Sabotage occurs
        partial (intelligence leaked selectively), corporate countermeasures prepared,
        media sensationalism profits advertisers, player escapes wealthy reputation
        mercenary. Outcome: Nobody wins entirely, player pragmatism cynical, Freedom
        Trail controversy ongoing, Night City values demonstrated.
      
      key_locations:
        - Old North Church (symbolic finale, "One if by land two if by sea" lanterns
          lit ceremony, confrontation occurs)
        - USS Constitution (Harbor, Sons Liberty escape route або FBI ambush depending
          path)
        - Boston Harbor (drones media coverage, player final choice visible city)
      
      npcs:
        - Marcus Revere (fate determined player choice - hero arrested exile depending)
        - Veronica Flag (arrested killed escape martyrdom depending path)
        - Dr. Noah Patent (reputation intact damaged ruined depending exposure)
      
      consequences:
        sabotage:
          - PatriotTech withdraws Boston, surveillance paused temporarily, investigations
            launched
          - Sons Liberty heroes terrorists depending perspective, arrests casualties
            possible
          - Marcus vindicated guilty violence, player reputation activist circles
            boosted
          - Freedom Trail protected short-term, long-term unclear, violence precedent
            set
        corporate:
          - Terrorism prevented, tourists safe, FBI praised efficiency
          - PatriotTech operations continue expanded, surveillance normalized accepted
          - Sons Liberty crushed leadership arrested, Marcus fugitive disillusioned
          - Player compensated corporate, reputation activists destroyed, guilt possible
        compromise:
          - Surveillance regulated transparency increased, opt-in required explicit
          - Historical sites council oversight established, corporate checked partially
          - Sons Liberty stands down violence avoided, principles compromised accepted
          - Player reputation mediator pragmatist, neither side fully satisfied, balance
            imperfect maintained
        exposure:
          - Media scandal PatriotTech surveillance illegal, contracts canceled legal
            trouble
          - Sons Liberty violence plans exposed public support minimal, arrests justified
          - Freedom Trail moratorium pending review, historical integrity preserved
          - Player reputation journalist hero whistleblower, corporate enemies made,
            activists grateful
        profit:
          - Chaos maximized player profits intelligence sold multiple parties
          - PatriotTech Sons Liberty both damaged partially, outcomes mixed messy
          - Player wealthy reputation mercenary pragmatist cynical, trust nobody future
          - Freedom Trail controversy ongoing resolution unclear, Night City values
            demonstrated capitalism wins

    marcus_initial: |
      Marcus: "Welcome Freedom Trail, friend. Normally give tour enthusiastically
      - Revolutionary history passion mine. Today different. See these?" (points AR
      implant kiosk) "PatriotTech calls 'enhanced heritage experience.' Call surveillance
      disguised patriotism. Need someone investigate corporate won't suspect. Interested?"
      
      Player: "What's in it for me?"
      
      Marcus: "Eddies modest truth priceless. History commodified sold highest bidder.
      Ancestors fought freedom, corporations exploit memory profit. Help expose?"
    
    veronica_recruitment: |
      Veronica: "Marcus says capable. Good. Need operators care principles not just
      eddies. PatriotTech cancer - surveillance normalized, patriotism weaponized,
      history commodified. Legal channels failed. Time action direct. With us?"
      
      Player: "Violence answer?"
      
      Veronica: "Violence language corporations understand. Peaceful protest ignored,
      petitions filed recycled, elections bought paid. EMP devices, data centers,
      CEO targeted - disruption forces change. Innocent endangered? Collateral regrettable
      necessary. Revolution messy. Choose side."
    
    patent_counter_offer: |
      Dr. Patent: "Appreciate meeting. Aware investigation concerns legitimate addressed.
      PatriotTech enhances education, funds preservation, modernizes experience. Surveillance?
      Data anonymized, consent obtained fine print, revenue sustains heritage sites
      otherwise neglected. Sons Liberty terrorists - violence threatens tourists,
      harms Boston, hijacks legitimate debate. Help prevent tragedy? Compensation
      generous, legal immunity guaranteed, doing right thing."
      
      Player: "Right thing? Whose definition?"
      
      Patent: "America's. Tourists' safety. Historical preservation pragmatic sustainable.
      Idealism admirable Marcus Veronica, methods dangerous counterproductive. Partner
      us, protect Freedom Trail terrorists corporate villains."

notes:
  design_intent: |
    Freedom Trail quest examines American patriotism commodified corporate surveillance
    normalized historical memory weaponized ideological conflicts. Boston Revolutionary
    War sites symbolic - freedom fought ancestors, freedom sold corporations exploited
    movements. Player navigates moral complexity: Surveillance unethical? Violence
    justified? Compromise betrayal? Profit pragmatism? No clean answers - choices
    consequences nuanced realistic uncomfortable. 
    
    Cyberpunk 2077 themes: Corporate dystopia commodifies everything including history,
    resistance methods questioned (violence terrorism? Legal channels ineffective?),
    patriotism weaponized manipulated, player agency respected outcomes branching
    meaningful. Boston setting deliberate - American exceptionalism critiqued, revolutionary
    legacy interrogated, freedom rhetoric corporate reality contradictions exposed.
  
  historical_context: |
    Freedom Trail real historic walking tour Boston 16 landmarks Revolutionary War
    (Boston Common, State House, Old North Church, Paul Revere House, USS Constitution
    etc). 2023 setting corporate sponsorship heritage sites increasing trend reality
    (AR tech museums, biometric tracking tourists, surveillance justified "security
    education"). Quest extrapolates trends cyberpunk lens - invasive normalized predatory.
    Sons Liberty 2.0 references original American revolutionary group, modern nationalist
    movements parallel examined (patriotism corporate resistance authoritarianism).
  
  player_guidance: |
    Quest accessible Boston 2023 early-game side content, level 5-10 recommended.
    Marcus Revere introduction Boston Common Freedom Trail starting point, investigation
    straightforward evidence gathering. Section 2 choices critical - player must
    decide loyalties before section 3 finale commitment. Branching outcomes replayable
    - different paths different consequences reputation impacts factions. Skill checks
    optional: Technical (hacking PatriotTech), Social (negotiating compromise), Combat
    (sabotage path violence).
  
  replay_value: Five distinct outcomes encourage multiple playthroughs, faction standings
    significantly altered, moral complexity invites different philosophical approaches.
