story:
  premise: |
    Boston 2027, Biotechnica corporation privatizing Massachusetts water supply -
    desalination plants controlled, public access restricted, prices exorbitant poor
    neighborhoods. Worse, Biotechnica dumping "TeaSynth" waste product synthetic
    tea manufacturing (corporate beverage replacing natural tea global markets) directly
    Boston Harbor contamination toxic fish dying neighborhoods affected. Environmental
    group "Green Wave Coalition" planning symbolic protest - dump TeaSynth barrels
    Harbor reenact 1773 Boston Tea Party British taxation, modern corporate exploitation.
    
    Player recruited protest organizer Riley Tide - infiltrate Biotechnica facility
    acquire TeaSynth samples evidence, participate Harbor dumping media coverage
    maximum, escape corporate security NCPD. Complications arise: Biotechnica aware
    protest plans infiltrator activist group (mole identity unknown), corporate countermeasures
    prepared (violent potentially), Riley hiding secret - TeaSynth dumping symbolic
    but smuggling operation real - stolen Biotechnica water purifiers sold black
    market profit genuine help poor.
    
    Player choices: Participate protest pure (idealism environmental heroism), discover
    smuggling help Riley (pragmatism profit good cause), expose Riley authorities
    (betrayal legality), sabotage Biotechnica permanently (escalation violence terrorism),
    negotiate corporate reform (compromise unlikely).

        Player contacted Riley Tide Green Wave Coalition meeting warehouse South
        Boston. Riley passionate speech Biotechnica water privatization - poor neighborhoods
        water shut off unpaid bills, desalination plants profit margins 400%, TeaSynth
        waste dumped Harbor illegally toxic contamination documented. Riley proposes
        symbolic protest modern Boston Tea Party - infiltrate Biotechnica facility
        steal TeaSynth barrels, dump Harbor media spectacle, pressure government
        regulation. Player recruited infiltration specialist - skills stealth hacking
        combat needed facility secured.
        
        Player tasks:
        1. Attend Green Wave meeting (activists introduced idealism contrasted pragmatism)
        2. Investigate Biotechnica facility (reconnaissance security assessed infiltration
          planned)
        3. Meet Captain Sam Harbor (ally recruited boat transport arranged)
        
        Outcome: Player understands environmental stakes, protest plan outlined,
        infiltration prepared.
      
      key_locations:
        - South Boston warehouse (Green Wave meeting, activists passionate diverse,
          Riley leadership charisma)
        - Biotechnica desalination plant (Harbor adjacent, security tight, TeaSynth
          storage tanks visible)
        - Boston Harbor docks (Captain Sam boat old reliable, Harbor pollution evident)
      
      npcs:
        - Riley Tide (quest giver charismatic secretive)
        - Captain Sam Harbor (ally reluctant principled)
        - Green Wave activists (background supporters, mole hidden among)

      description: |
        Player infiltrates Biotechnica facility night - stealth hacking combat optional
        depending playstyle. Objectives: Acquire TeaSynth barrels (evidence protest
        dump), access environmental data (pollution levels illegal documented), sabotage
        optional (escalation Riley encourages Sam opposes). During infiltration player
        discovers clues Riley's smuggling operation - water purifiers diverted shipments
        unaccounted inventory discrepancies corporate memos mention "internal theft
        investigation." Simultaneously, player encounters corporate mole - activist
        recognized facility employee Biotechnica badge, identity revealed choices
        immediate (confront, follow silently, ignore proceed).
        
        Complication: Facility lockdown initiated (mole alerted security або timer
        expired), player escape urgent TeaSynth barrels heavy slowing, corporate
        security pursuing lethal potentially. Captain Sam boat waiting Harbor extraction
        tense, Riley demands barrels secured priority, player choice: Prioritize
        barrels (protest succeeds), prioritize evidence (legal case stronger), prioritize
        escape (survival protest compromised), confront mole facility (risk capture
        loyalty tested).
        
        Post-infiltration, player confronts Riley smuggling discovered - Riley confesses
        pragmatically: Water purifiers stolen sold black market eddies fund Green
        Wave operations help poor afford Biotechnica prices, ends justify means argued,
        secrecy necessary activists naive idealists unaware. Player choice critical:
        Support Riley (pragmatism profit good cause), expose Riley activists (betrayal
        ideals), blackmail Riley (leverage profit personal), report authorities (legality
        activism destroyed).
      
      key_locations:
        - Biotechnica facility interior (labs sterile, storage industrial, security
          omnipresent cameras drones guards)
        - TeaSynth storage warehouse (barrels toxic green liquid, contamination evident,
          evidence pollution accessible terminals)
        - Harbor escape route (boat chase possible, NCPD helicopters spotlights, rain
          atmospheric tension)
      
      npcs:

        - Corporate mole (identity revealed confrontation possible)
        - Biotechnica security (combat encounters optional avoidable stealth)
        - Captain Sam Harbor (extraction boat moral compass questions Riley)
      
      choices:
        - Prioritize barrels (protest symbolic success)
        - Prioritize evidence (legal case pollution documented)
        - Prioritize escape (survival pragmatism mission compromised)
        - Confront mole (risk capture information gained)
        - Support Riley smuggling (pragmatism ends justify means)

        **Protest Success Path:** TeaSynth barrels secured, activists gathered Harbor
        night, media alerted coverage live, barrels dumped ceremonially Riley speech
        passionate corporate exploitation denounced. Public reaction mixed - environmentalists
        celebrate, moderates condemn vandalism, corporate retaliation swift (NCPD
        arrests lawsuit filed, Biotechnica PR campaign activists terrorists labeled).
        Outcome: Protest media success awareness raised, legal consequences activists
        face, Biotechnica reform pressured minimal changes, player reputation hero
        activists wanted corporate.
        
        **Evidence Path:** Pollution data secured TeaSynth samples analyzed toxic,
        legal authorities EPA contacted lawsuit environmental groups filed. Biotechnica
        investigated fines levied minimal damage, TeaSynth dumping ceased publicly
        continued secretly elsewhere, corporate lawyers delay justice years. Outcome:
        Legal victory partial slow frustrating, protest symbolic impact reduced,
        activists disappointed player pragmatic, Biotechnica adapts continues.

        Green Wave, trust shattered leadership questioned, protest canceled infighting,
        authorities arrest Riley criminal charges, Biotechnica exploits division PR
        victory activists discredited. Outcome: Idealism preserved activism destroyed,
        player moral high ground reputation mixed, environmental cause setback significant,
        Biotechnica wins unopposed.
        
        **Riley Supported Path:** Player assists Riley smuggling operation expanded,
        water purifiers stolen sold black market poor neighborhoods access affordable,
        protest proceeds funding secured smuggling profits, double victory symbolic
        practical. Risk: Corporate discovers smuggling eventually retaliation severe,
        activists unaware complicit potentially, player guilt profit pragmatism.
        Outcome: Pragmatism effective short-term, moral complexity long-term, poor
        helped activism funded, legality questioned sustainability uncertain.
        
        **Sabotage Path:** Player escalates violence - Biotechnica facility sabotaged
        permanently (desalination plant damaged, TeaSynth production halted, infrastructure
        destroyed), casualties possible (security guards workers collateral), terrorism
        labeled response government. Outcome: Corporate damaged significantly production
        disrupted, public backlash activists terrorism condemned, player hunted FBI
        Biotechnica mercenaries, environmental cause harmed extremism associated.

    riley_recruitment: |
      Riley: "Biotechnica privatizing water - basic human right commodified sold
      profit. Poor neighborhoods shut off, Harbor contaminated TeaSynth toxic, government
      captured regulatory useless. Remember 1773 Boston Tea Party? Colonists dumped
      tea protest taxation representation absent. Modern equivalent - dump TeaSynth
      protest corporate exploitation. Symbolic powerful media coverage pressure reform.
      Help us?"
      
      Player: "What's plan?"
      
      Riley: "Infiltrate facility steal TeaSynth barrels evidence, dump Harbor media
      watching, escape authorities. Risky necessary. Eddies modest cause priceless.
      In?"
    
    riley_confession: |
      Player: "Discrepancies facility - water purifiers missing inventory unaccounted.
      You smuggling?"
      
      Riley: "...Yes. Activists don't know naive idealists. Purifiers stolen sold
      black market eddies fund Green Wave operations help poor afford Biotechnica
      prices. Ends justify means - protest symbolic smuggling practical. Both necessary.
      Judge me?"
      
      Player: "Betraying trust activists."
      
      Riley: "Trust doesn't purify water. Eddies do. Idealism luxury can't afford.
      Support me exposure destroy everything accomplished. Choose."
    
    captain_sam_moral: |
      Captain Sam: "Riley good intentions road hell paved. Smuggling illegal endangers
      Harbor operations involve me unknowing. Protest support - non-violent symbolic
      righteous. Violence? Terrorism? Line crossed. Player, choices yours. Harbor
      seen enough pollution blood. Choose wisely."

notes:
  design_intent: |
    Boston Tea Party quest satirizes corporate water privatization environmental
    exploitation commodified protests historical reenactment. 1773 original symbolic
    - taxation representation absent, 2027 modern equivalent - corporate exploitation
    human rights denied government captured. Player navigates activism pragmatism
    - idealism pure protest symbolic, pragmatism smuggling effective illegal, violence
    terrorism escalation questioned. No clean answers moral complexity realistic
    uncomfortable.
  
  environmental_context: |
    Water privatization real contemporary issue (Nestle, Veolia, Suez corporations),
    Biotechnica Cyberpunk universe mega-corp biotechnology agriculture, TeaSynth
    fictional toxic waste product satirizes corporate pollution externalized costs.
    Boston Harbor historically significant - Tea Party 1773 Revolutionary War catalyst,
    modern pollution ongoing issue industrial legacy. Quest examines corporate dystopia
    basic human rights (water) commodified profited environmental harm unchecked
    resistance methods questioned.
  
  player_guidance: |
    Quest accessible Boston 2027 mid-game content level 10-15, Riley recruitment
    Harbor investigation straightforward. Section 2 infiltration stealth hacking
    combat skills tested, mole discovery smuggling revelation player choices critical.
    Section 3 finale consequences player decisions moral complexity examined, branching
    outcomes replayable different philosophical approaches. Optional objectives:
    Sabotage facility (violence escalation), confront mole (information risk), support
    smuggling (profit pragmatism).
  
  replay_value: Five outcomes encourage multiple playthroughs, moral philosophies
    tested (idealism pragmatism legality violence), faction standings altered significantly.
