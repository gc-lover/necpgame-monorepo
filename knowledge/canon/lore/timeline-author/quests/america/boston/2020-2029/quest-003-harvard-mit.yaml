story:
  premise: |
    Boston 2025, historic Harvard-MIT rivalry reaches crisis - both universities
    competing Arasaka corporate grant $500 million AI ethics research (ironic corporation
    notorious unethical practices). Harvard team led Professor Evelyn Crimson (philosophy
    ethics theoretical), MIT team led Dr. Marcus Circuit (engineering AI practical).
    Rivalry personal professional - Crimson Circuit former collaborators romantic
    partners bitter breakup 2020, academic disagreements turned vendetta, sabotage
    escalating theft plagiarism dirty tricks.
    
    Player hired rival teams simultaneously (unaware double agent initially) - Harvard
    wants MIT research stolen (prove Circuit plagiarized Crimson's theories), MIT
    wants Harvard sabotaged (Crimson's presentation Arasaka ruined publicly). Player
    navigates absurdity - academics petty cutthroat corporations, ethical AI research
    funded unethical corporation paradox ignored, intellectual superiority claimed
    both sides sabotage childish. Choices: Side Harvard (theory ethics prioritized),
    side MIT (practical application valued), expose both (corruption revealed Arasaka
    grant canceled), steal research both (sell highest bidder profit), mediate reconciliation
    (former lovers collaborate grant shared).

      title: Двойной агент / Double Agent
      description: |
        Player contacted Harvard Professor Crimson - needs MIT research stolen Circuit's
        AI algorithms source code (prove plagiarism Crimson's theories allegedly),
        compensation generous academic access granted. Simultaneously, player contacted
        MIT Dr. Circuit - needs Harvard presentation sabotaged Arasaka grant meeting
        (Crimson embarrassed publicly MIT wins), compensation competitive lab equipment
        offered. Player realizes hired rival teams double agent unintentionally,
        absurdity academic rivalry exposed immediately.
        
        Player tasks:
        1. Meet Professor Crimson Harvard Yard (pretentious philosophical monologue
          MIT inferiority)
        2. Meet Dr. Circuit MIT campus (pragmatic dismissive Harvard "ivory tower
          nonsense")
        3. Investigate Arasaka liaison Kenji (corporate funding ethical AI research
          paradox ironic)
        
        Outcome: Player understands rivalry personal professional petty, corporate
        manipulation suspected, choices sides mediation profit presented.
      
      key_locations:
        - Harvard Yard (historic prestigious, Crimson office philosophy books towers,
          condescension palpable)
        - MIT Stata Center (modern chaotic, Circuit lab robotics hum, pragmatism
          emphasized)
        - Arasaka liaison office Boston Downtown (corporate sterile, Kenji amused
          rivalry exploits)
      
      npcs:
        - Professor Evelyn Crimson (quest giver Harvard, intellectual arrogant, ex-lover
          bitter)
        - Dr. Marcus Circuit (quest giver MIT, practical dismissive, ex-lover defensive)
        - Kenji Tanaka (Arasaka liaison, manipulative amused, corporate cynicism)
      
      choices:
        - Accept Harvard job (side theory ethics philosophical)
        - Accept MIT job (side practical application engineering)
        - Accept both jobs (double agent profit risk exposure)
        - Refuse both (walk away quest ends morality intact eddies lost)
        - Investigate Arasaka (suspicion corporate manipulation early uncovered)
    
    section_2_sabotage_theft:
      title: Академические грязные трюки / Academic Dirty Tricks
      description: |
        Player executes double agent missions absurdity escalates. Harvard mission:
        Infiltrate MIT lab night steal Circuit's AI research servers encrypted databases
        source code (stealth hacking required), plant evidence plagiarism Crimson's
        papers (fabricate scandal). MIT mission: Infiltrate Harvard office sabotage
        Crimson's Arasaka presentation slides corrupted data falsified embarrassment
        public (technical sabotage), steal Crimson's research notes (leverage blackmail).
        
        Complications: Player discovers truth - neither plagiarized, both brilliant
        independently, rivalry personal breakup 2020 professional disagreement (Crimson
        wanted theoretical ethics prioritized, Circuit wanted practical AI development,
        compromise impossible egos inflated). Worse, player finds evidence Arasaka
        manipulation - Kenji deliberately funding rival teams sabotage encouraged,
        research quality secondary corporate spectacle universities desperate grant
        compete destructively, winner predetermined Arasaka benefits both outcomes
        (Harvard ethics PR tool, MIT engineering weaponized).
        
        Player choice critical:
        - Complete both missions (profit maximum chaos escalates)
        - Sabotage Harvard only (side MIT practical valued)
        - Sabotage MIT only (side Harvard ethics prioritized)
        - Expose Arasaka manipulation (grant canceled both lose universities warned)
        - Steal research both sell (highest bidder profit academia betrayed)
        - Mediate Crimson Circuit (former lovers reconcile collaborate grant shared)
      
      key_locations:
        - MIT lab night (security robots patrol, Circuit's servers encrypted advanced
          AI prototype visible)
        - Harvard office night (Crimson's notes personal philosophical profound, presentation
          files vulnerable)
        - Arasaka files accessed (corporate emails manipulation exposed Kenji cynicism
          documented)
      
      npcs:
        - Security guards both campuses (combat avoidable stealth preferred)
        - Student assistants unaware (collateral damage sabotage innocent)
        - Kenji Tanaka (player confronts manipulation optional)
      
      choices:
        - Complete both missions (profit chaos)
        - Sabotage Harvard only (side MIT)
        - Sabotage MIT only (side Harvard)
        - Expose Arasaka (grant canceled both warned)
        - Steal research sell (profit academia betrayed)
        - Mediate reconciliation (former lovers collaborate)

        - Boston Marriott ballroom (corporate sterile, academics nervous, Kenji podium
          judges)
        - Harvard MIT campuses post-presentation (celebrations disasters depending
          outcome)

    crimson_recruitment: |
      Crimson: "Harvard MIT rivalry historic civilized until Circuit betrayed collaboration
      2020 prioritized engineering philosophy dismissed. Now Arasaka grant exists
      - ironic unethical corporation funds ethical AI research paradox ignored desperately.
      Need MIT research stolen prove Circuit plagiarized my theories. Help?"
      
      Player: "What's in for me?"
      
      Crimson: "Compensation generous, academic resources Harvard library access,
      intellectual satisfaction justice served. Also revenge sweet admitted privately."
    
    circuit_recruitment: |
      Circuit: "MIT Harvard rivalry historic pragmatic until Crimson sabotaged partnership
      2020 prioritized theory practicality dismissed. Now Arasaka grant opportunity
      - corporate funding compromised admitted reluctantly necessary. Need Harvard
      presentation sabotaged Crimson embarrassed publicly MIT wins. Help?"
      
      Player: "Sounds petty."
      
      Circuit: "Petty effective. Academia cutthroat appearance civilized. Compensation
      competitive lab equipment offered, MIT reputation enhanced, Crimson defeated
      satisfying acknowledged personally."

      Player: "Discovered emails - manipulation deliberate sabotage encouraged. Explain."
      
      Kenji: "Ah, perceptive. Yes, funding rival teams intentional - competition
      innovation allegedly, reality entertainment Arasaka benefits universities desperate.
      Ethical AI research? PR tool. Winner predetermined? Perhaps. Academics egos
      inflated exploit easily. Judgment?"
      
      Player: "Cynical."
      
      Kenji: "Realistic. Corporate world. Expose? Scandal minor. Arasaka survives,
      universities embarrassed, player enemy made. Choose wisely."

notes:
  design_intent: |
    Harvard MIT quest satirizes academic rivalry petty cutthroat ivory tower pretensions
    deflated, corporate funding corrupts independence ethical AI research paradox
    unethical corporation funds, sabotage absurd serious consequences careers destroyed.

  academic_context: |
    Harvard MIT rivalry real historic Boston universities - intellectual prestige
    Nobel laureates research excellence, rivalry friendly competitive occasionally
    petty (pranks hacks traditions). Quest exaggerates cyberpunk dystopia - corporate
    funding Arasaka unethical mega-corp ethical AI research paradox satirizes reality
    (defense contractors fund university research, oil companies environmental studies,
    tobacco health programs). Crimson Circuit former collaborators lovers breakup
    academic personal mirrors real academic partnerships dissolved egos disagreements.
  
  player_guidance: |
    Quest accessible Boston 2025 mid-game level 8-12, double agent missions stealth
