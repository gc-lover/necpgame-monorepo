  cultural_context:
    boston_beer_tradition: |
      Boston's beer culture is inseparable from its revolutionary history. Samuel Adams
      wasn't just a brewer - he was a Founding Father who used his tavern as a meeting
      place for revolutionaries. In the cyberpunk era, this tradition represents the
      struggle between authentic American culture and corporate homogenization.

    craft_vs_corporate: |
      The battle between craft brewing and corporate synthetics mirrors broader societal
      conflicts. Do you preserve the artisanal methods that made Boston beer famous,
      or embrace the efficiency and accessibility of synthetic alternatives?

    revolutionary_symbolism: |
      Beer becomes a symbol of resistance against corporate control. Just as the original
      Tea Party protested taxation without representation, modern Bostonians protest
      synthetic "beer" that represents corporate control over personal pleasure.
