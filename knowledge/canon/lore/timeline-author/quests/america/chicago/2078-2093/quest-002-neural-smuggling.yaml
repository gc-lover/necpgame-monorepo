    title: Introduction
    body: 'In the neon-drenched underbelly of Chicago, neural implants are the new gold. Corporate giants develop cutting-edge cybernetics, but the real money is in the black market. You''ve been approached by a fixer who needs a reliable courier for a high-value neural implant delivery.

The job pays well, but failure means either corporate detention or worse - having your own implants hacked and turned against you.'

- Chicago''s tunnel system provides perfect smuggling routes under the city

- Corporate security uses neural scanners to detect unauthorized implants

- Underground factions control different neural implant specialties

- Betrayal is common; trust is a luxury few can afford'

    body: 'Chicago''s streets pulse with neural signals. Holographic advertisements promise "Enhanced Humanity" while corporate security drones scan for unauthorized implants. Underground markets hide in abandoned subway tunnels, where fixers trade whispers of the latest neural tech.

The constant threat of neural hacking creates tension - one wrong connection and your own mind becomes the enemy.'
