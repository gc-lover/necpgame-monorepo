  brief: |
    Pyramids rising. Mystery ancient. Tourists swarming. Archaeologist discovering. Gods whisper stones.
  
  description: |
    Teotihuacan 2027. 50km northeast Mexico City, ancient metropolis ruins 100-750 CE,
    UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mexico's most-visited archaeological zone. Pyramid
    of the Sun (third-largest world), Pyramid of the Moon, Avenue of the Dead, Temple
    Feathered Serpent. Nahuatl name: Teōtīhuacān ("place where gods are born"). Mystery
    profound - builders unknown (pre-Aztec), city abandoned mysteriously 750 CE, rediscovered
    Aztecs centuries later, mistook gods' work. Archaeological enigma persists.
    
    **Dr. Elena Vásquez (39)** - Lead archaeologist INAH (National Institute Anthropology
    History), excavating restricted zone beneath Pyramid Moon. Discovery unprecedented:
    Hidden chamber untouched 1,300 years, glyphs undeciphered, artifacts unknown technology
    (too advanced period?), acoustic anomalies (chamber resonates specific frequencies),
    astronomical alignments precise (calendar calculations accurate). Scientific sensation,
    government nervous (national identity implications), fringe theorists excited (ancient
    aliens predictably).
    
    Dilemma emerges: INAH pressures quick excavation, documentation, public announcement
    (tourism revenue $$$), preservation secondary. Elena resists - chamber fragile,
    artifacts irreplaceable, rushed excavation destroys context, knowledge lost forever.
    Professional integrity vs institutional pressure vs personal ambition (discovery
    career-defining).
    
    Complication: Chamber sealed deliberately - glyphs warn (translated partially):
    "Sacred ground. Gods' resting place. Disturbance brings... [untranslatable]."
    Warning ominous, interpretation uncertain. Curse superstition (científica rational)
    or cultural respect warranted? Local indigenous communities (Nahua descendants)
    request excavation halt - sacred site, ancestors' wishes honored, tourism desecration.
    Ethical archaeology colonialism legacy surfacing.
    
    You - documentary filmmaker, covering discovery. Elena grants exclusive access,
    trusts your discretion. Witness scientific process, ethical dilemmas, mysterious
    phenomena (acoustic frequencies cause hallucinations? Coincidence?), stakeholder
    conflicts. Choices influence: Elena's career, chamber's fate, indigenous voices,
    historical truth, mystery preservation.

  goal: |
    Navigate Teotihuacan discovery: Support scientific integrity, respect indigenous
    requests, prioritize tourism revenue, or explore mystery personally. Archaeology,
    ethics, wonder collide pyramids' shadow.

  essence: |
    Archaeological mystery quest. Science vs mysticism, preservation vs exploitation,
    indigenous rights vs national interests, knowledge vs wonder. Teotihuacan's real
    mystery foundation - unknown builders, unexplained abandonment, enduring enigma.
    Respectful both scientific method and cultural reverence.

story:
  background: |
    Teotihuacan history: Founded ~100 BCE, peaked 450 CE (population 125,000+, sixth-largest
    city world then), mysteriously abandoned ~750 CE (theories: drought, internal conflict,
    invasion - uncertain). Aztecs discovered ruins 1300s, named Teotihuacan ("place
    gods born"), incorporated mythology (believed gods created sun/moon there). Spanish
    conquest 1521, site looted. Scientific excavation began 1884, continues today.
    Major mysteries persist: Who built (pre-Aztec, unknown ethnicity)? Why abandoned?
    What technology enabled (engineering sophisticated, astronomical knowledge precise)?
    
    Pyramid Sun/Moon: Sun 225m base, 65m height, built ~200 CE. Moon 150m base, 43m
    height, aligned lunar cycles perfectly. Avenue Dead 2.5km, connects structures,
    oriented 15.5° east north (intentional, astronomical significance debated). Acoustic
    properties discovered 1990s - pyramids amplify/reflect sound specific frequencies,
    ritual purposes suspected. Mica found structures (conducts electricity? Ceremonial?
    Imported 3,000km? Why?). Advanced mathematics evidenced architecture - calendar
    calculations accurate, urban planning geometrically precise. Sophisticated civilization,
    abrupt disappearance. Mystery captivating.

  opening: |
    Monday dawn, Pyramid Moon base. Restricted excavation zone, Elena's team 10 archaeologists,
    ground-penetrating radar revealed chamber 3 months ago, entrance tunnel completed
    yesterday. Elena briefs team: "Chamber sealed 1,300 years. Sterile protocols,
    documentation everything, preservation priority. This career-defining discovery.
    Let's honor responsibility."
    
    You document: Cameras rolling, Elena descends tunnel (claustrophobic limestone
    passage, carved precisely, no modern tools evidenced), team follows, lights illuminate
    chamber progressively. Gasps collective - chamber intact, artifacts preserved impossibly,
    walls covered undeciphered glyphs, central altar obsidian (reflective, mirrors
    light eerily), acoustic properties immediate (footsteps echo multiply, voices resonate
    harmonically). Awe tangible.
    
    Elena whispers: "This... unprecedented. Glyphs unknown style, artifacts don't match
    period technology, chamber acoustics intentional (resonance frequencies specific).
    Document everything. Touch nothing yet." Scientific discipline overriding excitement
    barely.
    
    Discovery specifics: Obsidian mirrors (polished perfectly, reflect strangely -
    optical illusion or craftsmanship?), jade figurines (carved microscopic detail,
    tools required non-existent), mica sheets (insulation? Conduction? Purpose unclear),
    codices fragments (pictographs indecipherable, preservation miraculous). Central
    altar inscribed warning glyphs: "Teotl īxiptlah. Mācēhualtzin motztinemih. Yōllōtl..."
    Translation partial: "God's image. Mortals disturb. Heart... [unclear]."

  act_one: |
    **Day 2-5: Analysis conflicts**
    
    **Scientific path:** Elena methodical - photogrammetry chamber, spectral analysis
    artifacts, acoustic frequency mapping, glyph documentation. Discoveries fascinating:
    Acoustic resonance 110 Hz (affects human consciousness, induces meditative states
    scientifically documented), obsidian mirrors reflect UV differently (ceremonial
    astronomy?), jade figurines depict cosmology (star maps encoded?). Elena excited,
    cautious: "Need months analysis. Rushing destroys context."
    
    INAH headquarters intervenes: Director calls, pressure explicit: "President wants
    announcement 2 weeks. G20 summit Mexico City, international publicity opportunity,
    tourism revenue projected $500M annually. Fast-track analysis, prepare findings."
    Elena protests: "Impossible. Chamber fragile, artifacts require careful study,
    premature announcement risks..." Director interrupts: "Two weeks, Elena. Career
    advancement depends compliance." Threat clear.
    
    **Indigenous intervention:** Nahua community elders arrive site, request meeting.
    Tlacaelel (74) spokesperson: "Our ancestors rest here. Glyphs warn. You disturb
    sacred ground. Tourism profits don't justify desecration. Close chamber, respect
    spirits, honor treaty (indigenous consultation required Mexican law, часто ignored)."
    Elena conflicted: "I respect your culture, ale scientific knowledge benefits humanity.
    Compromise possible?" Tlacaelel firm: "Knowledge vs reverence? False choice. Our
    ancestors knew things science rediscovering. Maybe closed for reason. Listen warning."
    
    **Mystery deepens:** Night 3, Elena returns chamber alone (against protocols),
    you follow documenting. Chamber acoustic properties strange - 110 Hz resonance
    induces visions (Elena sees geometric patterns, hears whispers Nahuatl, feels
    presence). Rational scientist shaken: "Hallucinations? Ultrasound effects brain?
    Or... something more?" Recording equipment malfunctions (electromagnetic interference?
    Coincidence?). Mystery seductive, unsettling.

  act_two: |
    **Decision paths:**
    
    **Path A: Support Elena's integrity (slow, careful research)**
    
    You advocate: Article published "Teotihuacan Discovery: Science vs Spectacle,"
    argue rushing destroys irreplaceable knowledge, preservation paramount. Public
    support archaeology community, pressure INAH reconsider. Elena grateful: "Thank
    you. Needed ally."
    
    Outcome: INAH grants 6-month extension, Elena's team continues methodically. Discoveries
    profound - acoustic chamber ritual space (induces altered consciousness ceremonially),
    astronomical observatory (star maps accurate pre-telescope era), mathematics advanced
    (zero concept, calendar sophisticated). Papers published, peer-reviewed, career
    secure. Tourism delayed, але eventual (2028, chamber exhibits respectfully). Knowledge
    preserved, science honored.
    
    **Path B: Respect indigenous requests (halt excavation)**
    
    You amplify: "Indigenous Rights vs Archaeological Ambition" documentary, Tlacaelel
    interviewed extensively, legal precedent cited (indigenous consultation laws). International
    pressure mounts (UN Indigenous Rights Rapporteur statement), INAH forced negotiate.
    
    Agreement: Chamber resealed, indigenous-led oversight committee established, limited
    research permitted (non-invasive), site managed cooperatively. Elena disappointed
    initially, accepts gradually: "Maybe Tlacaelel right. Some mysteries preserved,
    not solved. Respect warranted." Tourism restricted (small groups, indigenous guides),
    revenue shared communities. Cultural preservation prioritized, science secondary.
    
    **Path C: Enable quick excavation (tourism priority)**
    
    You document: Government perspective featured, economic benefits emphasized, INAH
    director interviewed favorably. Public opinion sways tourism revenue (jobs, infrastructure,
    national pride). Elena pressured comply, excavation accelerated.
    
    Consequences: Chamber artifacts extracted rapidly, context lost (documentation
    insufficient), several artifacts damaged (haste consequences), glyphs photographed
    incompletely. Tourism boom 2028 - Teotihuacan visitors double, revenue increases,
    infrastructure expanded. Але knowledge incomplete, indigenous community alienated,
    Elena's career tainted (scientific community criticizes), mystery commercialized.
    
    **Path D: Explore mystery personally (fringe theory investigation)**
    
    You obsess: Spend nights chamber, record acoustic phenomena, analyze visions,
    research fringe theories (ancient aliens, Atlantis, interdimensional portals -
    ridiculous але... acoustic properties unexplained, mathematical precision anomalous,
    abandonment mysterious). Elena skeptical, intrigued: "I'm scientist. But phenomena
    real, explanations insufficient. What if... ancients knew something we forgot?"
    
    Investigation: Acoustic frequencies mapped (110 Hz, 70 Hz, specific harmonics),
    geometric patterns visions consistent (sacred geometry encoded?), astronomical
    alignments too precise (star maps include constellations invisible naked eye -
    how?). Documentary: "Teotihuacan: Science Can't Explain" - viral, controversial,
    mainstream archaeologists criticize, public fascinated. Mystery preserved, wonder
    amplified, answers elusive.

  epilogue: |
    **Three years later (2030):**
    
    **Scientific integrity path:** Chamber fully analyzed, findings revolutionary -
    Teotihuacan builders possessed astronomical knowledge rivaling modern, acoustic
    engineering intentional (ritual consciousness alteration), mathematics sophisticated
    (influenced later Mesoamerican cultures). Elena published 3 books, keynote conferences,
    career pinnacle. Chamber exhibits 2028, respectfully (dim lighting, limited visitors,
    educational focus). Tourism sustainable, knowledge preserved, mystery explained
    partially (many questions remain). Indigenous community consulted throughout, grudging
    acceptance. Science/respect balanced imperfectly.
    
    **Indigenous respect path:** Chamber sealed, indigenous oversight continues. Limited
    research non-invasive (acoustic studies, astronomical observations, glyph analysis
    respectful). Tlacaelel's community manages site, small-group tours emphasize cultural
    reverence, traditional ceremonies resumed. Elena shifted focus other sites, respects
    decision. Tourism modest, revenue community-controlled, site preserved spiritually.
    Mystery honored, not solved. Western science secondary, indigenous knowledge centered.
    Decolonization archaeology small victory.
    
    **Tourism priority path:** Teotihuacan visitors tripled (2M+ annually), economic
    boom local, infrastructure modern (hotels, restaurants, cable car Pyramid Sun proposed
    2031). Chamber commercialized - gift shop, VR experiences, selfie spots. Scientific
    knowledge incomplete (rushed excavation), indigenous community displaced (gentrification),
    Elena quit archaeology (disillusioned), site Disneyfied. Economic success, cultural
    loss. Pyramid shadow grows, mystery trivial.
    
    **Mystery exploration path:** Your documentary phenomenon (10M+ views), inspired
    global interest ancient mysteries, fringe theories mainstream attention, scientific
    community divided (some investigate acoustic consciousness research seriously,
    others dismiss pseudoscience). Teotihuacan pilgrimage site seekers (spiritual tourism
    boom), indigenous community mixed feelings (commercialization different flavor),
    Elena frustrated (serious research overshadowed speculation). Mystery amplified,
    wonder commercialized differently, truth ambiguous. Ancient secrets whisper still,
    modern understanding incomplete.
    
    Teotihuacan endures - pyramids standing, mysteries persisting, gods silent. "Place
    where gods are born" - maybe metaphor consciousness, knowledge, wonder. Builders
    gone, legacy remains, questions eternal. Elena reflects: "Archaeology teaches
    humility. Ancients knew things we're rediscovering. Progress isn't linear. Respect
    past, question present, embrace mystery." Camera pans Pyramid Sun, sunset golden,
    ancient stones eternal. Credits roll. Mystery continues.

  design_notes: |
    Archaeological mystery respectful both science and mysticism. Teotihuacan real
    enigma - unknown builders, unexplained abandonment, sophisticated technology genuine
    mysteries. Chamber fictional але acoustic properties, astronomical alignments,
    mathematical precision real documented phenomena. 110 Hz frequency consciousness
    effects scientifically studied. Quest doesn't answer mysteries definitively -
    shows complexity navigating science, ethics, culture, wonder. Elena represents
    scientific integrity vs institutional pressure realistic tension. Tlacaelel indigenous
    rights decolonization archaeology important movement. Tourism vs preservation
    real tension archaeological sites worldwide. Four paths reflect different priorities:
    Science (knowledge preserved), indigenous (respect centered), tourism (economics
    prioritized), mystery (wonder amplified). Outcomes honest - scientific path knowledge
    gained mystery explained partially, indigenous path cultural victory science secondary,
    tourism path economic success cultural loss, mystery path speculation mainstreamed
    truth ambiguous. No perfect solution. Educational Teotihuacan history, Mesoamerican
    civilization, archaeological ethics, indigenous rights contemporary relevance.
    Respectful ancient knowledge - acoustic engineering, astronomical observations,
    mathematical sophistication real not romanticized. Mystery preserved narratively -
    some questions unanswered intentionally, wonder maintained. Decolonization archaeology
    theme important - indigenous consultation, cultural reverence, Western science
    limitations acknowledged. Accessible complex themes - science, spirituality, politics,
    economics intersecting archaeological discovery.
