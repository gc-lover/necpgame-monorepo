  brief: |
    Arena packed. Mask sacred. Legacy heavy. Luchador rising. Honor everything.

  description: |
    Mexico City 2026. Lucha libre - Mexican professional wrestling, national passion,
    cultural institution. Not just sport - mythology living, good vs evil theatricalized,
    masks identity sacred, family dynasties generations. Arena México cathedral, Friday
    nights ritual, crowds roaring, legends made/destroyed single match.

    **Miguel "El Relámpago" Cortés (24)** - Third-generation luchador, grandson legendary
    El Trueno (Thunder, retired 2010), son El Rayo (Lightning, died ring 2015 heart
    attack Miguel 13 watching). Family legacy crushing - El Trueno undefeated champion
    30 years, El Rayo promising career cut short, Miguel expected greatness inherited.
    Reality: Struggling mid-card wrestler, wins inconsistent, crowd indifferent, promoters
    losing faith. Mask weighs heavy.

    Crisis emerges: Arena México announces "Leyenda vs Leyenda" match - two legendary
    luchadors, loser unmasks (ultimate humiliation, identity revealed, career essentially
    over). El Huracán (Hurricane, 45, técnico/hero, five-time champion) challenges
    El Dragón Negro (Black Dragon, 42, rudo/villain, bitter rival 20 years). Storyline
    perfect, але twist: El Dragón injured secretly, promoters need replacement. Offer
    Miguel substitute rudo role - career opportunity massive, але dishonors grandfather's
    técnico legacy (heroes/villains sacred distinction lucha libre), risks family name.

    Complication: El Dragón's mask Miguel's father's last opponent (2015 match heart
    attack occurred). Family trauma reopened. Grandfather El Trueno forbids: "Cortés
    family técnicos always. Rudo role betrays everything. Refuse." Sister Ana supports
    practical: "Career opportunity rare. Take it, prove yourself, honor comes later."
    Miguel torn.

    You - sports journalist, lucha libre historian, covering match. Interview Miguel
    crisis, your questions/perspective influence decision. Witness training, family
    tensions, cultural weight masks carry, drama unfolds Arena México.

  goal: |
    Help Miguel decide: Accept rudo role career opportunity, refuse honor family legacy,
    find creative compromise, или withdraw pressure. Mask, honor, family, ambition
    collide.

  essence: |
    Family legacy quest. Lucha libre cultural institution - masks sacred identity,
    técnico/rudo roles mythological, family dynasties generational, honor paramount.
    Miguel's struggle universal - living up parents, finding own path, choosing duty
    vs opportunity. Wholesome spectacle, meaningful depth.

story:
  background: |
    Lucha libre history: Originated 1930s Mexico, evolved unique style - high-flying
    acrobatics, colorful masks, dramatic storytelling. Masks sacred - hide identity,
    embody character, never removed public (unmasking ultimate defeat/dishonor). Técnicos
    (heroes) vs rudos (villains) eternal battle, crowd participation essential, family
    dynasties common (skills/legacy passed generations).

    Arena México: Built 1956, Cathedral Lucha Libre, 16,500 capacity, Friday night
    tradition 70 years. Legends made here - El Santo, Blue Demon, Mil Máscaras, countless
    others. Cultural institution - working class entertainment, national pride, mythology
    accessible.

    Cortés dynasty: El Trueno (Thunder) debuted 1978, técnico pure, never turned rudo,
    champion 1985-2010, retired undefeated (rare honor), mask never lost, legend status.
    Son El Rayo (Lightning) debuted 2005, promising career, técnico like father, 2015
    match vs El Dragón Negro collapsed ring (heart condition undiagnosed), died 32
    leaving wife, Miguel 13, Ana 16. Tragedy haunts family. Miguel debuted 2020 El
    Relámpago (Smaller Lightning), pressure immense, results disappointing, confidence
    shattered. Legacy burden, not gift.

  opening: |
    Monday morning, Arena México training facility. Miguel practices alone - running
    ropes, drilling moves, exhausted sweating. Technique solid, intensity lacking,
    frustration visible. Trainer Don Chuy watches sadly: "Miguel, you have talent,
    skill, legacy. Missing? Heart. Fire your grandfather had, your father had. Where's
    yours?"

    Miguel collapses corner: "How find fire grandfather's shadow? Every match, crowd
    expects El Trueno reborn. I'm not him. I'm not my father. I'm just... Miguel.
    Failing everyone."

    Promoter Raúl enters urgent: "Miguel, opportunity. El Dragón injured, can't wrestle
    Friday. Need replacement Leyenda vs Leyenda match. You'd rudo opposite El Huracán.
    Main event, national TV, career breakthrough. Interested?"

    Miguel shocked: "Rudo? I'm técnico. Family tradition. Grandfather would..."

    Raúl interrupts: "Grandfather retired 16 years. This 2026. Opportunity rare. Say
    yes or remain mid-card forever. Your choice."

    You approach after (interview arranged): "Miguel, thoughts? Rudo role first time?"

    Miguel conflicted: "El Dragón... my father's last opponent. Died during their
    match. Now wear his mask? Feels wrong. But career dying too. What I do?"

  act_one: |
    **Stakeholders weigh in:**

    **Grandfather El Trueno (72):**

    Visit home Coyoacán, El Trueno shrine-like - masks displayed, trophies countless,
    photos generations. Trueno firm: "Cortés family técnicos ALWAYS. Heroes, not villains.
    Your father técnico, I técnico, you técnico. Rudo role? Spits legacy face. Refuse
    absolutely. Rather you quit than dishonor family."

    Shows father's mask (El Rayo preserved), emotion raw: "Your father died honorably,
    fighting clean técnico style. El Dragón's rudo tactics stressed his heart. Now
    you wear enemy's mask? Betray your father's memory? Never."

    Harsh, inflexible, але love evident. Trueno sacrificed everything lucha libre,
    expects Miguel same devotion. Tradition sacred, compromise impossible.

    **Sister Ana (29):**

    Coffee shop Roma, Ana pragmatic (accountant, corporate job): "Abuelo lives past.
    You live present. Career opportunity rare lucha libre. Take rudo role, prove yourself,
    técnico identity returns later. Legends turned rudo temporarily before - El Santo,
    Blue Demon, common. Not betrayal, strategy. Honor flexible. Survival essential."

    Adds financial reality: "You earn 5,000 pesos ($250) per match now. Main event?
    50,000+ ($2,500). Mom needs surgery costs mounting. Rent overdue. Honor doesn't
    pay bills. Pragmatism does. Father would want family provided."

    **Mother Carmen (55):**

    Home visit, Carmen diplomatic: "Your father and grandfather fought same fights -
    tradition vs opportunity, honor vs necessity. Choose wisely, але choose yourself.
    Legacy important, але YOUR life yours. I support whatever decision. Just... be
    safe. Losing your father enough. Can't lose you too."

    Shows medical bills discreetly: Diabetes complications, insurance insufficient.
    Financial pressure unspoken, present.

    **Don Chuy (trainer, 60):**

    Gym honest talk: "Miguel, técnico/rudo roles performance. Wrestling storytelling,
    mythology, entertainment. You're actor wearing mask, playing character. Rudo role
    main event? Learn heeling (villain tactics), crowd psychology, character depth.
    Expand skills, broaden career, return técnico later stronger. Or refuse, remain
    mid-card, resentment grows. Choose."

  act_two: |
    **Decision paths:**

    **Path A: Accept rudo role**

    Miguel agrees: "I'll do it. Family disappointed, але career needs this. One match
    rudo, prove myself, return técnico after." Training intensifies - heel tactics
    (rule breaking, crowd taunting, dirty tricks), character development El Relámpago
    Oscuro (Dark Lightning), psychology villain embrace.

    Family reaction: Trueno refuses speak, heartbroken silence. Ana supportive. Carmen
    worried. Pressure mounting.

    Match week: Media attention huge, promos filmed (Miguel's rudo persona emerging
    uncomfortable naturally), storyline building. El Huracán (veteran professional)
    guides: "Rudo role liberating. Rules constraints removed. Crowd hates you means
    invested. Make them believe."

    Friday night Arena México: 16,500 capacity sold out, atmosphere electric. Entrance
    rudo (crowd booing, Miguel conflicted internally), match spectacular (chemistry
    Huracán excellent, storytelling compelling), finish dramatic. Outcome determined
    path chosen.

    **Path B: Refuse, honor legacy**

    Miguel declines: "Thank you, ale I can't. Family técnico tradition sacred. Grandfather
    right. Rather struggle mid-card honorably than succeed dishonorably." Promoter
    disappointed, booking reduced.

    Trueno proud: "Correct choice. Honor preserved. Opportunities return respect shown."
    Ana frustrated: "Stubborn pride solves nothing. Bills mount regardless."

    Consequence: Career stagnates months, financial stress increases, family tension
    grows. Miguel questions decision privately, але masks never lie. Tecnico identity
    preserved, success delayed, integrity intact.

    Unexpected opportunity: September, veteran técnico El Ángel Justiciero (Avenging
    Angel, 50) retires, recommends Miguel replacement tag team partner. Slower path,
    але honorable, crowd gradually warming, legacy building properly.

    **Path C: Creative compromise**

    You suggest: "What if rudo role temporary character development? Storyline: El
    Relámpago corrupted temporarily, redemption arc later técnico return? Wrestling
    theater. Character evolution common. Honor preserved through narrative."

    Miguel intrigued: "Temporary villain redeemed? Grandfather accept?" Negotiate promoter -
    six-month rudo arc, redemption storyline guaranteed, técnico identity returns climactic.

    Trueno grudgingly accepts: "Storyline clear temporary? Redemption guaranteed? Still
    distasteful, але compromise possible. You perform well, I watch." Compromise Mexican
    way - nobody fully happy, everyone moves forward.

    **Path D: Withdraw completely**

    Miguel overwhelmed: "Pressure too much. Training gym job instead. Teach lucha
    libre, não perform. Family legacy heavy burden. Maybe I'm not meant ring." Career
    ends quietly.

    Family reactions varied: Trueno disappointed, Ana understanding, Carmen relieved
    (safety priority). Miguel finds peace coaching, legacy transmitted differently -
    teaching students, preserving technique, less spotlight pressure. Alternative
    success, personal peace, masks retired.

  epilogue: |
    **Match outcome (Rudo path):**

    Spectacular performance - Miguel's rudo tactics effective, crowd hating perfectly,
    Huracán selling dramatically. Finish: Miguel cheats blatantly (classic rudo), gets
    caught, Huracán wins clean, crowd erupts. Miguel unmasks ceremoniously (reveals
    face, identity preserved mask removal controlled), boos transition respect (performance
    recognized), career elevated. Técnico return 2027, redemption arc beloved, legacy
    reclaimed differently.

    **One year later (2027):**

    **Rudo success:** Miguel established mid-card mainstay, main events occasional,
    redemption storyline completed (técnico return emotional, crowd welcomed), grandfather
    reconciled (pride admitted grudgingly), family financial stress relieved. Mask
    metaphor fulfilled - removed/replaced, identity evolved, legacy honored differently.
    Career thriving, traditions adapted.

    **Honor preserved:** Miguel respected but limited star, technical excellence recognized,
    crowd loyal small, financial struggle ongoing. Trueno proud, Carmen stressed, Ana
    distant. Alternative paths wondered quietly. Integrity uncompromised, success modest,
    peace uncertain. Legacy's weight carried honorably, cost high.

    **Compromise executed:** Six-month rudo arc completed perfectly, redemption massive
    storyline (Miguel vs corrupt promoter, técnico allies, justice restored theatrically),
    crowd invested deeply. Best outcome - family satisfied, career advanced, traditions
    respected, innovation embraced. Mexican compromise embodied - loud disagreements,
    eventual consensus, family intact. Miguel finds voice within legacy, neither copy
    nor rejection - evolution.

    **Coaching path:** Miguel trains promising young luchadors, legacy transmitted
    teaching not performing. Gym thriving modestly, students winning championships,
    Cortés name respected differently. Trueno visits weekly (unexpected bonding), Ana
    helps business side, Carmen relaxed (son safe). Success redefined - impact over
    spotlight, knowledge shared, traditions preserved, personal peace achieved. Masks
    hung wall, honored retired.

    Lucha libre continues - Arena México roaring Fridays, new legends rising, old
    masks passing, traditions evolving. Miguel's choice one of thousands, masks stories,
    honor meanings multiple. El Relámpago flashes still - ring or gym, mask or face,
    lightning strikes differently. Legacy lives, adapted, honored, continued. ¡Viva
    lucha libre!

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Family legacy quest through lucha libre cultural lens. Masks sacred identity Mexico -
    never removed public, embody character, pass generations. Técnico/rudo distinction
    mythological - heroes vs villains, crowd investment essential, roles performance
    але culturally weighted. Miguel's struggle universal - living up parents, finding
    own path within/beyond legacy, choosing duty vs opportunity. Four paths reflect
    different values: Rudo acceptance prioritizes career pragmatism, honor preservation
    maintains tradition cost, creative compromise bridges old/new, withdrawal redefines
    success. Arena México real Cathedral Lucha Libre 1956, Friday tradition authentic.
    Cortés dynasty fictional але representative real dynasties (El Santo family, Blue
    Demon family, countless others). Father's ring death tragic але happens (Eduardo
    "Silver King" 2019, Hijo del Perro Aguayo 2015, others). Financial pressures real -
    mid-card wrestlers earn modest, medical costs crushing. Family dynamics authentic
    Mexican - grandfather's authority respected, sister's pragmatism growing, mother's
    diplomacy mediating. Compromise Mexican cultural value - loud disagreements, eventual
    consensus, family intact. Quest educational lucha libre history/culture, respectful
    art form (not mockery), shows performance art deeper meaning. Wholesome spectacle
    meaningful depth - colorful masks, dramatic matches, але family pressure, identity
    questions, financial stress underneath. Miguel finds voice within legacy neither
    copy nor rejection - evolution. Mask metaphor rich - hide identity, embody character,
    removed reveals/transforms. Quest doesn't resolve "correct" choice - shows tradeoffs,
    respects different priorities, honors complexity.
