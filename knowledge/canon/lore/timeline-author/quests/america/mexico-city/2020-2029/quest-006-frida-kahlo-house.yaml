    Blue walls. Pain transformed. Icon commodified. Artist remembered. Legacy contested.
  
  description: |
    Coyoacán 2029. Casa Azul (Blue House) - Frida Kahlo's birthplace/deathplace, museum
    since 1958, Mexico's most-visited artist home, 500K+ visitors annually. Cobalt
    blue walls iconic, interior preserved meticulously, courtyard garden lush, wheelchair
    visible (polio/accident consequences), paintings few (mostly museums), personal
    artifacts many. Atmosphere heavy - suffering palpable, creativity triumphant,
    love/pain inseparable.
    
    Frida Kahlo (1907-1954): Mexican painter, surrealist (self-described Mexican realist),
    communist, feminist icon (posthumously), Diego Rivera's wife (tumultuous), chronic
    pain survivor (polio 6, bus accident 18 - spine broken, pelvis shattered, lifelong
    agony), 55 self-portraits (43% oeuvre - "I paint myself because I am alone"),
    unibrow/mustache unapologetic, Mexican identity fierce (Tehuana dresses, indigenous
    roots celebrated), bisexual openly, miscarriage grief painted, death welcomed
    finally ("Viva la Vida" last painting). Complex human, simplified icon.
    
    2029 controversy: Casa Azul announces "Frida Reimagined" exhibition - contemporary
    artists reinterpreting legacy, feminist readings, queer identity exploration,
    commercialization critique, pain aestheticization questioned. Curated Dr. Sofia
    Mendoza (38, art historian, Frida scholar), controversial immediately. Critics
    divided - necessary updating vs disrespectful revisionism, honoring complexity
    vs exploitation continuing.
    
    You - art journalist, invited early access, interview stakeholders, document debates.
    Witness preparation, understand tensions, choose positioning. Frida's legacy alive,
    contested, evolving. Dead 75 years, more famous now than living. Iconization's
    costs/benefits visible Casa Azul walls.

  goal: |
    Navigate Casa Azul controversy: Support exhibition innovation, defend traditional
    curation, expose commercialization, или balance perspectives. Art, identity, legacy
    stakes high.

  essence: |
    Artist legacy quest. Frida Kahlo icon complex - pain transformed art, Mexican
    identity asserted, gender/sexuality defied, leftist politics lived, но commodified
    posthumously (t-shirts, emojis, filtered pain), complexity flattened, suffering
    romanticized. Quest explores iconization's double edge, curation ethics, artistic
    legacy ownership, contemporary relevance navigation.

story:
  background: |
    Frida brief bio: Born 1907 Coyoacán (claimed 1910 - Mexican Revolution birth mythologized),
    polio 1913 (right leg atrophied), bus accident 1925 (steel handrail impaled pelvis,
    spine broken multiple places, lifelong pain/surgeries 30+), began painting recovery
    bedridden, met Diego Rivera 1928 (muralist famous, 20 years older, married 1929,
    divorced 1939, remarried 1940 - relationship passionate toxic creative), Paris
    exhibition 1939 (Louvre acquired painting - first Mexican artist), Diego affairs
    numerous (including Frida's sister Cristina), Frida affairs both genders (Trotsky,
    Josephine Baker, others), miscarriages/abortions multiple (pelvis injuries prevented
    childbirth - grief profound paintings), right leg amputated 1953 (gangrene),
    died 1954 age 47 (officially pulmonary embolism, suspected suicide - pain unbearable
    finally).
    
    Legacy evolution: Moderate recognition living, obscurity after death initially,
    feminist rediscovery 1970s-80s (autobiography writings, pain/female experience
    articulated powerfully), posthumous fame exploded 1990s-2000s (exhibitions worldwide,
    record auction prices, popular culture ubiquity), 2020s commodification peak
    (Frida merchandise $100M+ annually, face t-shirts/tote bags/phone cases, unibrow
    beauty trend, suffering aestheticized Instagram, complexity lost commercialization).
    
    Casa Azul museum 1958: Diego donated house Frida's death, preserved rooms, courtyard
    garden, wheelchair, bed mirror ceiling (painted lying down), personal effects,
    artworks few. Intimate space, suffering tangible, creativity evident. 500K+ visitors
    annually, selfie spot unfortunately (disrespectful often), reverence/voyeurism
    mixed uncomfortably.

  opening: |
    Monday morning, Casa Azul. Curator Dr. Sofia Mendoza briefs press: "Frida Reimagined
    explores legacy contemporary lens - feminist politics, queer identity, chronic
    pain disability rights, commercialization critique, Mexican identity nationalism.
    75 years death, time reassess icon worship. Complexity deserves honoring, not
    simplification."
    
    Exhibition controversial: Contemporary artists responding Frida's work - some
    respectful homages, others critical deconstructions, few provocative (Frida emoji
    installation mocking commodification, menstrual blood painting referencing miscarriage
    grief, Diego effigies burned symbolically - toxic masculinity commentary). Traditional
    curators horrified, younger audiences intrigued.
    
    Three voices emerge:
    
    **Maestro Carlos Fuentes (76)** - Old guard curator, Frida contemporary knew personally
    (childhood Coyoacán neighbor), traditionalist: "Exhibition disrespects Frida's
    memory. She suffered enough living. Now posthumously exploited 'reimagining'?
    Preserve integrity, not sensationalize pain. Casa Azul sacred space, not contemporary
    art playground."
    
    **Dr. Sofia Mendoza (38)** - Young curator, Frida scholar PhD, feminist art historian:
    "Carlos sentimentalizes. Frida radical living - communist, bisexual, challenged
    norms constantly. Static museum worship betrays her spirit. Evolution honors legacy,
    stagnation kills it. Contemporary dialogue necessary, not disrespectful - engaging."
    
    **Valentina Torres (29)** - Disability rights activist, chronic pain survivor,
    wheelchair user: "Everyone interprets Frida. But as disabled woman chronic pain?
    Frida's suffering romanticized, aestheticized, inspiration-porned ('She suffered
    beautifully!'). Where's my representation beyond tragedy? Exhibition must address
    ableism Frida's legacy perpetuates unintentionally."
    
    You interview all, tensions obvious. Visit Casa Azul private tour Sofia, see
    rooms Frida's pain lived (bedroom bed mirror, bathroom wheelchair, studio unfinished
    canvases), understand space sacred/contested simultaneously.

  act_one: |
    **Exhibition preparation reveals divides:**
    
    **Traditional curation (Carlos's vision):**
    
    Carlos argues: Preserve Casa Azul exactly - Frida's belongings untouched, rooms
    sacred, contemporary art separate building if necessary, reverence priority. "Frida
    icon because authentic, unfiltered. Tampering dilutes. Museum responsibility preserve,
    not reinterpret. Let Frida speak herself through artifacts, paintings, space."
    
    Shows you Diego's letters Frida, intimate photographs, personal diary pages (never
    displayed publicly - too vulnerable). "These sacred. Sofia wants 'recontextualize.'
    I say respect privacy death grants. Frida performed life, deserves peace death.
    Boundaries matter."
    
    Valid concern: Artistic legacy exploitation fine line curation/violation. Dead
    can't consent. Carlos's conservatism protective, not merely reactionary.
    
    **Contemporary reinterpretation (Sofia's vision):**
    
    Sofia counters: "Frida performed identity consciously - Tehuana dresses political,
    unibrow defiant, self-portraits strategic. She WANTED dialogue, challenge, provocation.
    Static museum embalms. Living legacy evolves. Contemporary artists responding
    Frida continues conversation she started. Respectful disagreement homage."
    
    Shows you exhibition pieces: Queer artist repainting self-portraits non-binary,
    disabled artist wheelchair performance Casa Azul courtyard (reclaiming space),
    feminist collective burning Diego effigies (toxic relationship acknowledged critically).
    Provocative yes, disrespectful? Debatable. Art provokes. Frida understood.
    
    **Disability justice critique (Valentina's intervention):**
    
    Valentina challenges both: "Carlos preserves Frida's suffering aesthetically -
    wheelchair displayed artifact, pain romanticized tragedy. Sofia's exhibition still
    aestheticizes - 'beauty from suffering' narrative persists. Where's critique disability
    fetishization? Where's acknowledgment Frida's pain SUCKED, not inspired? I'm
    tired being inspiration because I suffer visibly. Frida deserved better living.
    Deserves better legacy now."
    
    Demands exhibition include: Chronic pain reality (unsexy, unglamorous, daily hell),
    medical misogyny Frida endured (30+ surgeries, doctors dismissive, morphine addiction
    consequence), disability community perspective (not abled curators interpreting),
    suffering not romanticized (acknowledged compassionately honestly).
    
    Challenges everyone: "You all use Frida. Carlos nostalgia, Sofia career, culture
    merchandise. When does Frida exist beyond what you need her be?"

  act_two: |
    **Decision paths:**
    
    **Path A: Support traditional preservation**
    
    You write: "Casa Azul Should Remain Sacred: Against Reimagining Frida" - argue
    respect artist's legacy means preservation not reinterpretation, contemporary
    art separate spaces appropriate, intimacy Casa Azul requires reverence, boundaries
    matter posthumously. Carlos vindicated, Sofia's exhibition scaled back dramatically,
    traditional curation restored.
    
    Consequence: Casa Azul attendance stable (traditionalists satisfied), younger
    audiences disengaged (static museum boring), legacy frozen (Frida icon unchanging,
    complexity acknowledged but not explored), disability critique ignored (status
    quo preserved). Cultural preservation achieved, evolution prevented. Safe, stagnant.
    
    **Path B: Champion contemporary reinterpretation**
    
    You write: "Frida Would Want Reimagining: Evolution Honors Legacy" - argue Frida
    radical living, static museum betrays spirit, contemporary dialogue respectful
    engagement, provocation homage, living legacy requires evolution. Sofia triumphant,
    exhibition proceeds fully, traditionalists appalled.
    
    Consequence: Casa Azul attendance surges (controversy attracts), younger audiences
    engaged (relevant discussions), legacy dynamic (Frida conversations ongoing),
    але boundaries questionable (privacy violations potential), traditionalists alienated
    (respect concerns dismissed). Cultural evolution achieved, preservation questioned.
    Provocative, contentious.
    
    **Path C: Center disability justice critique**
    
    You write: "Whose Frida? Disability Community Reclaims Narrative" - amplify Valentina's
    critique, challenge abled curators interpreting disabled experience, demand disability
    scholars inclusion, critique suffering romanticization, address ableism legacy
    perpetuates. Exhibition revised significantly - disability justice framework central,
    chronic pain reality unsexy portrayed, medical trauma acknowledged, inspiration
    porn rejected.
    
    Consequence: Casa Azul transformed (disability accessible improved, chronic pain
    education added, ableism confronted), disability community grateful (representation
    authentic), both Carlos/Sofia challenged (privilege examined), visitors uncomfortable
    (pain unsexy truth confronting), attendance initially drops (difficult content),
    long-term respect earned (integrity prioritized). Justice centered, comfort sacrificed.
    Necessary, uncomfortable.
    
    **Path D: Balanced compromise**
    
    You mediate: Facilitate dialogue Carlos/Sofia/Valentina, find middle ground -
    Casa Azul rooms preserved traditionally (intimacy respected), contemporary art
    separate wing added (evolution enabled), disability justice framework integrated
    (ableism confronted), boundaries negotiated collectively (consent proxies honored).
    Messy compromise, multiple voices heard.
    
    Consequence: Exhibition proceeds modified - provocative pieces contextualized (not
    censored), traditional spaces sacred (boundaries maintained), disability critique
    central (ableism addressed), all stakeholders partially satisfied (nobody fully
    happy - compromise nature). Attendance steady, conversations rich, legacy complex
    (appropriately). Imperfect, realistic, respectful.

  epilogue: |
    **Two years later (2031):**
    
    **Traditional preservation:** Casa Azul museum respected, traditional, declining
    relevance younger generations. Frida icon frozen 1950s, complexity acknowledged
    minimally, disability issues ignored, comfort maintained. Carlos retired satisfied,
    Sofia left frustrated (career stalled), Valentina continues activism elsewhere
    (Casa Azul missed opportunity). Legacy preserved, evolution prevented. Safe but
    stagnant.
    
    **Contemporary reinterpretation:** Casa Azul controversial hub - exhibitions rotate
    provocative, attendance record-breaking, debates fierce, Frida legacy dynamic.
    Carlos died disappointed (traditionalist fears realized?), Sofia internationally
    acclaimed curator (career ascendant), Valentina ambivalent (disability issues
    addressed sometimes, aestheticized others). Legacy alive, boundaries blurred.
    Provocative but questionable.
    
    **Disability justice centered:** Casa Azul disability rights landmark - wheelchair
    accessible fully, chronic pain education pioneering, ableism confronted systemically,
    disabled artists featured prominently. Attendance modest (difficult content scares
    tourists), disability community grateful (authentic representation), Carlos's
    family accepts eventually (justice honored Frida), Sofia credits Valentina (privilege
    examined growth). Legacy transformed, comfort sacrificed. Justice prioritized,
    necessary uncomfortable truth.
    
    **Balanced compromise:** Casa Azul multifaceted - traditional rooms preserved,
    contemporary wing thriving, disability framework integrated, debates ongoing healthy.
    Carlos died peace (integrity maintained), Sofia career successful (innovation
    enabled), Valentina advisory board permanent (voice institutionalized). Attendance
    steady diverse, legacy complex appropriately, conversations rich. Nobody fully
    satisfied (compromise nature), everyone respected. Imperfect realistic sustainable.
    
    Frida endures - icon, commodity, artist, disabled woman, Mexican, communist, lover,
    sufferer, creator. 75 years death, debates intensifying not resolving. Legacy
    living means contested. Casa Azul blue walls witness all - tourism, reverence,
    exploitation, evolution, justice demands, compromises messy. Frida painted herself
    because alone. Now never alone - surrounded interpreters, admirers, critics, activists,
    tourists. Would she appreciate attention? Hate commodification? Demand justice?
    Laugh ironically? All above probably. Complex human deserves complex legacy. Blue
    house pain transforms still. Viva la Frida. Viva la complejidad.

  design_notes: |
    Frida Kahlo legacy quest respectful complex icon. Biography accurate - polio,
    bus accident, chronic pain, Diego relationship, communist politics, bisexuality,
    miscarriage grief, artwork themes. Casa Azul real museum Coyoacán, preserved 1958.
    Controversy fictional але reflects real debates artist legacy curation, posthumous
    iconization, commercialization ($100M+ merchandise annually documented), disability
    representation, feminist reinterpretation. Carlos represents traditionalist preservation
    concerns valid - boundaries posthumously, intimacy respected, exploitation prevented.
    Sofia represents contemporary evolution necessary - static museum embalms, living
    legacy dialogues, Frida's radical spirit honored through challenge not reverence.
    Valentina centers disability justice critique essential - suffering romanticization
    harmful, abled curators interpreting disabled experience problematic, inspiration
    porn rejected, chronic pain reality unsexy acknowledged. Four paths reflect real
    tensions: Preservation safe але stagnant, reinterpretation provocative але boundaries
    blurred, disability justice necessary але uncomfortable, compromise imperfect
    але sustainable. Quest doesn't prescribe "correct" answer - presents complexity,
    respects multiple perspectives, acknowledges iconization's double edge (visibility
    але commodification, inspiration але simplification, legacy але ownership contested).
    Educational Frida's life/art/politics, Mexican cultural icon, feminist symbol,
    disability representation issues. Respectful Frida's memory complexity - pain
    acknowledged not romanticized, art celebrated not commodified, humanity honored
    not simplified. Heavy tone appropriate - Casa Azul space suffering creativity
    inseparable, reverence voyeurism mixed, legacy living means contested.
