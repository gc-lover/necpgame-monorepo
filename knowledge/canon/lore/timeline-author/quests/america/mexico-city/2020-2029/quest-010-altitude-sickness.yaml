  description: |
    Chapultepec Park 2029, Mexico City Marathon starting line. 25,000 runners registered,
    elite athletes international, amateur enthusiasts local/tourist, charity runners
    emotional causes. Course 42.195km (26.2 miles) standard marathon, BUT altitude
    2,240m (7,350 ft) above sea level - oxygen ~25% less than sea level, performance
    ~10-15% decreased, altitude sickness risk significant unprepared runners. Medical
    tents staffed heavily, oxygen tanks ready, warnings broadcast repeatedly: "Hydrate
    constantly, pace conservatively, recognize symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness,
    fatigue), seek help immediately."
    
    **Mexico City altitude reality:**
    
    CDMX sits Valley of Mexico (basin mountain-ringed), elevation average 2,240m,
    surrounding peaks higher (Popocatépetl 5,426m, Iztaccíhuatl 5,230m visible skyline),
    atmospheric pressure ~77% sea level, oxygen partial pressure reduced proportionally.
    Effects cumulative: Visitors experience headaches, fatigue, nausea, insomnia (acute
    mountain sickness AMS mild), locals acclimatized generations (larger lung capacity,
    more red blood cells, oxygen efficiency increased evolutionarily), athletes struggle
    (endurance sports particularly affected - marathon, soccer, cycling), performance
    decreased measurably (world records rare high altitude).
    
    Acclimatization process: 1-3 days mild symptoms, 1-2 weeks partial adaptation
    (red blood cell production increases, breathing deepens), months/years full adaptation
    (genetic factors, childhood residence crucial). Deacclimatization reverse - lowland
    residents visiting sea level feel "supercharged" temporarily (oxygen abundance),
    highlanders descended feel gravity lighter.
    
    Crisis: Marathon features Daniel Torres (28, elite runner Boston, Chicago records,
    Mexico City debut), arrived 2 days ago (insufficient acclimatization, confidence
    overrode warnings), goal win/qualify Olympics. Race begins, Daniel leads aggressively
    (pace sea-level equivalent - unsustainable altitude), kilometer 25 collapses (severe
    AMS, cerebral edema suspected, life-threatening). You - sports journalist covering,
    witness collapse, decision urgent: Rush hospital immediately (race abandoned, life
    prioritized), continue running descend lower (gradual altitude decrease helpful
    possibly), або wait medical tent (oxygen/assessment, race continues). Stakes high
    literally - Daniel's life, marathon's reputation, altitude's unforgiving physics.

  goal: |
    Respond medical emergency: Prioritize hospital evacuation (safe conservative),
    attempt gradual descent (risky creative), wait medical assessment (protocol reasonable),
    или involve local runners' knowledge (community wisdom). Altitude indifferent ambitions,
    physiology absolute, choices matter immediately.

  essence: |
    Human limits quest. Mexico City altitude constant invisible challenge - locals
    adapted, visitors struggle, athletes humbled. Quest explores physiology (altitude
    effects educational), hubris (Daniel's overconfidence tragic), community (local
    runners' knowledge valuable), human fragility (limits real despite willpower).
    Respectful medicine, stakes genuine, Mexico City's thin air protagonist silent
    powerful.

story:
  background: |
    Altitude physiology: Sea level atmospheric pressure 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi), oxygen
    ~21% atmosphere, partial pressure ~21 kPa absorbed lungs efficiently. 2,240m altitude
    pressure ~77 kPa, oxygen percentage unchanged 21%, але partial pressure ~16 kPa
    (25% less), lungs absorb oxygen reduced proportionally, blood oxygen saturation
    drops (sea level ~98%, altitude ~90-92% unacclimatized), tissues receive less
    oxygen, performance decreases (cardiovascular, muscular, cognitive).
    
    Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS): Mild - headache, fatigue, nausea, insomnia (common
    2,000m+, recovers days), Moderate - vomiting, severe headache, weakness (medical
    attention needed), Severe - ataxia (loss coordination), altered consciousness
    (HACE High Altitude Cerebral Edema), pulmonary edema (HAPE fluid lungs). Treatment:
    Descent immediate (most effective), oxygen supplementation, medications (acetazolamide
    Diamox, dexamethasone emergencies), rest hydration. Prevention: Gradual ascent
    (acclimatization days), hydration (3-4L daily), avoid alcohol/sleeping pills,
    recognize symptoms early.
    
    Mexico City marathon history: Established 1983, 25K+ runners annually, altitude
    notorious (times slower 10-15% than sea level equivalents), medical emergencies
    frequent (AMS, dehydration, cardiac), elite runners arrive early acclimatize
    (1-2 weeks optimal), locals advantage significant (lifetime acclimatization),
    course scenic (Reforma Avenue, Chapultepec Park, Centro Histórico, Zócalo), atmosphere
    festive (mariachi bands, families cheering, food vendors), medical support extensive
    (tents every 5km, ambulances ready, hospitals alerted).
    
    Daniel Torres background: Boston native, sea level trained, marathon times impressive
    (2:08:34 Boston 2028 - elite level), Olympic trials qualifier, confidence high
    (youth invincibility), Mexico City debut mistake (arrived 2 days ago, acclimatization
    insufficient, dismissed warnings "I'm elite - physiology doesn't apply"). Coach
    Mike advised 10-day arrival, Daniel overruled ("expensive, unnecessary, I'm prepared").
    Race strategy aggressive - lead early, pressure competitors, finish strong. Physiology
    had other plans.

  opening: |
    Sunday morning 7:00 AM, Chapultepec Park. Marathon starting line, 25K runners
    stretching nervous excited, mariachi bands playing, families cheering, autumn
    air cool thin (visible breath, lungs working harder). Daniel Torres bib #007
    (elite seeding), warming up confident, interviewed pre-race: "Altitude's overrated.
    I trained Boston sea level, ran 2:08. Today maybe 2:12-2:15 accounting altitude,
    still winning pace. Competitors warned me. I'm different. Elite physiology. Watch."
    
    You - sports journalist, covering marathon feature story "International Runners
    vs Mexico City Altitude." Interview local runner Rosa Martínez (35, born/raised
    CDMX, 15 marathons, best 2:45): "Altitude doesn't care credentials. Daniel arrived
    2 days ago? Trouble. Needs 10-14 days minimum. I see tourists collapse Marathon
    every year. Ambulances ready reason. Hope he's careful."
    
    Race begins 7:30 AM. Daniel leads immediately, pace 3:05/km (aggressive sea level,
    reckless altitude), kilometer 5 still leading, breathing heavy visible, kilometer
    10 pace maintained (medics watching concerned), kilometer 15 slowing slightly
    (3:20/km, still fast), kilometer 20 struggling (3:45/km, competitors passing),
    Rosa among them (steady 3:50/km, acclimatized efficient). Kilometer 25 (Reforma
    Avenue, crowds thick), Daniel staggers, stumbles, collapses sideways. Crowd gasps,
    medics rush, you follow journalist instinct.
    
    Daniel conscious barely, speech slurred: "Head... pounding... can't... breathe..."
    Medics assess: Pulse 180 bpm (dangerously high), oxygen saturation 78% (critical
    low), pupils unequal (cerebral edema suspected), coordination absent (can't touch
    nose). Lead medic Dr. Sanchez urgent: "Severe AMS, possible HACE. Need hospital
    immediately - CT scan, oxygen, dexamethasone IV. Ambulance 5 minutes. Protocol
    clear."
    
    Rosa arrives, stops running (compassion overrides competition): "I've seen this.
    My cousin died Popocatépetl climb - HACE, too proud descend. Daniel needs hospital
    NOW. Altitude kills stubbornness." Another runner Marco (local, paramedic trained)
    suggests: "Ambulance stuck traffic (Sunday morning, Reforma closed marathon).
    Hospital 8km west, lower altitude (2,180m vs 2,240m here - small але helpful).
    Continue running slow, descent gradual, oxygen improves possibly. Risky, але ambulance
    delayed maybe 20 minutes traffic."
    
    Dr. Sanchez protocol: Wait ambulance, oxygen mask, monitor vitals, hospital arrival
    guaranteed safe. Marco alternative: Gradual descent, creative risky, ambulance
    traffic real issue. Rosa wisdom: Hospital immediately, life over race/pride, cousin's
    death haunts. Daniel semi-conscious, choice yours journalist-turned-emergency-responder.

  act_one: |
    **Options weighed:**
    
    **Dr. Sanchez protocol (wait ambulance):**
    
    Medical assessment oxygen mask Daniel, vitals monitored, consciousness fluctuating.
    Sanchez explains: "HACE life-threatening - brain swells altitude, pressure increases
    skull, herniation risks, death possible hours. Oxygen helps temporarily, descent
    critical, hospital CT/medications essential. Ambulance GPS shows 18 minutes traffic
    (Reforma Avenue marathon closure alternate routes congested). Daniel stable oxygen
    currently, deterioration possible rapidly. Protocol safe - wait, monitor, transport
    hospital. Deviation risky - liability, complications unpredictable, my license
    jeopardy. Journalist documenting - record I advised protocol clearly."
    
    Rosa interjects: "18 minutes? Daniel's lips blue, pupils unequal, speech gone.
    Cousin deteriorated 10 minutes - coma, death. Waiting kills sometimes. Ambulance
    stuck, hospital distant, descent HERE possible. I'm not medical, але I've lived
    altitude lifetime. Instinct says move."
    
    **Marco alternative (gradual descent running):**
    
    Marco proposes: "Hospital 8km west, downhill slightly (2,240m→2,180m, 60m descent
    small але cumulative), street access parallel marathon route, wheelch Marco alternative
    (gradual descent running):**
    
    Marco proposes: "Hospital 8km west, downhill slightly (2,240m→2,180m, 60m descent
    small але cumulative), street access parallel marathon route, wheelchair medical
    cart available (used injured runners), push Daniel slowly westward, oxygen portable
    tank carried, arrival hospital 25 minutes estimated (vs ambulance 18 minutes BUT
    altitude decreases progressively). Risk: Deterioration movement, oxygen tank limited,
    cerebral edema worsens jostling possibly. Benefit: Descent immediate, altitude
    decreases gradually (physiology responds descent fastest), hospital arrival comparable
    ambulance. Paramedic instinct - descent trumps waiting sometimes. Your call."
    
    Dr. Sanchez objects: "Liability nightmare. Daniel moves, worsens, sues, I'm finished.
    Protocol exists reasons - legal, medical, statistical. Creative solutions sound
    heroic, look reckless court. Journalist - record objection clearly."
    
    **Rosa wisdom (community knowledge):**
    
    Rosa shares: "Altitude teaches humility generations. Abuelo climbed Popocatépetl
    guided tourists 40 years, rules absolute: Descent sacred, pride kills, listen
    body, community survives individuals sacrifice. Daniel ran ego, collapsed predictably,
    now depends strangers' choices. Medical protocols foreign (American, sea-level
    designed), altitude wisdom local (generations tested). Marco's plan sounds crazy
    doctors, sounds survival us. Journalists choose - record tragedy or enable rescue.
    Cousin died waiting 'proper' help. Altitude doesn't wait protocols."

  act_two: |
    **Decision paths:**
    
    **Path A: Wait ambulance (protocol safe):**
    
    You support: Dr. Sanchez protocol, wait ambulance oxygen monitoring, liability
    clear, safety prioritized, medical standards followed. Ambulance arrives 22 minutes
    (traffic worse estimated), Daniel deteriorates meanwhile (consciousness lost, seizure
    brief, vitals critical), hospital arrival 35 minutes post-collapse, CT confirms
    HACE severe, ICU admission, dexamethasone/oxygen/intubation, coma 3 days, recovery
    2 weeks, brain damage permanent mild (coordination affected, memory gaps, marathon
    career ended). Dr. Sanchez vindicated protocol ("proper procedures followed, outcome
    unfortunate HACE severity not negligence"), Rosa haunted ("waited again, another
    lost minutes"), Marco frustrated ("protocols killed speed"), Daniel sues race
    organizers (settles $500K, warnings inadequate alleged). Survival achieved, damage
    permanent, protocols followed, questions linger: Faster response prevented deterioration?
    Safe choice cost outcome?
    
    **Path B: Gradual descent running (creative risky):**
    
    You enable: Marco's plan, wheelchair cart Daniel, oxygen portable, westward descent
    slow, Rosa pushes (strength acclimatized), Marco monitors (paramedic trained),
    you document (journalist record). Descent begins, Daniel consciousness improves
    marginally (altitude decreases, oxygen partial pressure increases slightly), 4km
    progress vitals stable, 6km Daniel wakes briefly ("where...?"), 8km hospital arrival
    28 minutes post-collapse (comparable ambulance BUT altitude decreased progressively).
    ER immediate, CT confirms HACE moderate (descent helped prevented severe), ICU
    overnight, dexamethasone/oxygen, consciousness returns next day, recovery 1 week,
    brain damage minimal (full recovery probable). Dr. Sanchez conflicted ("outcome
    good, але procedure violated, luck not science"), Rosa grateful ("descent saved
    him, cousin's lesson honored"), Marco vindicated ("paramedic instinct correct,
    protocols rigid sometimes"), Daniel humbled ("ego nearly killed me, strangers
    saved, altitude respected finally"). Risky choice successful, questions remain:
    Deterioration worsened jostling? Protocol safer statistically? Creative heroism
    or reckless luck? Outcome justifies means?
    
    **Path C: Hybrid approach (descent attempt, ambulance backup):**
    
    You mediate: Begin Marco's descent, Dr. Sanchez coordinates ambulance intercept
    route (GPS tracks wheelchair, ambulance redirects meeting point), oxygen monitoring
    continuous, decision reassessed progress. Descent begins, 3km Daniel stable oxygen
    cart, 5km ambulance intercepts Reforma (traffic cleared police escort finally),
    transfer Daniel ambulance, hospital arrival 25 minutes post-collapse (faster than
    waiting, safer than full descent wheelchair). CT confirms HACE moderate-severe
    (cusp), ICU 2 days, recovery 10 days, brain damage mild (coordination slightly
    affected, recovers mostly). Dr. Sanchez satisfied ("protocol adapted, medical
    oversight maintained, outcome acceptable"), Rosa accepting ("descent started crucial,
    ambulance completed sensible"), Marco collaborative ("teamwork effective, rigid
    divisions unnecessary"), Daniel grateful survived ("altitude lesson learned, community
    saved"). Compromise effective, risks distributed, outcome favorable, collaboration
    modeled. Mexican problem-solving - loud debate, creative adaptation, teamwork
    prevails.
    
    **Path D: Defer local wisdom fully (Rosa/Marco lead):**
    
    You amplify: Rosa/Marco know altitude intimately, Dr. Sanchez respects defers,
    descent begins immediately oxygen cart, local runners assist (chain passing wheelchair,
    oxygen rotated, vitals monitored collectively), community response organic (marathon
    pauses briefly, runners/spectators help, altitude wisdom collective). Descent
    rapid coordinated (8km 20 minutes, local knowledge street shortcuts), hospital
    arrival fastest (24 minutes post-collapse), CT confirms HACE moderate (early intervention
    prevented severe), recovery 5 days, brain damage absent (full recovery). Dr. Sanchez
    awed ("community medicine effective, protocols learn humility"), Rosa fulfilled
    ("cousin's memory honored, altitude wisdom validated"), Marco proud ("local knowledge
    saved life, outsiders listened"), Daniel transformed ("elite credentials meant
    nothing, strangers' generosity everything, altitude teacher harshest kindest").
    Community-centered response, local knowledge prioritized, collective action effective,
    altitude respect cultural embodied. Decolonize emergency medicine - protocols
    inform, communities lead, wisdom local valued.

  epilogue: |
    **One year later (2030):**
    
    **Protocol followed:** Daniel recovered permanent coordination issues, marathon
    career ended, lawsuit settled race warnings strengthened, Dr. Sanchez protocol
    adherence strict (fear liability), altitude casualties continue (tourists unprepared,
    warnings ignored, protocols rigid slow). Survival achieved, costs high personally/systemically.
    Medical-legal concerns trump creative response, outcomes suffer marginally statistics,
    individuals lost cracks protocols.
    
    **Creative descent:** Daniel recovered fully, returns Mexico City Marathon 2030
    (arrived 14 days early, acclimatized properly, finishes 2:18 altitude-adjusted
    personal best, hugs Rosa/Marco emotional gratitude), altitude respect public (story
    viral, warnings heeded), Dr. Sanchez protocols loosened (creative responses permitted
    medical oversight), paramedic Marco protocols revised (gradual descent recognized
    alternative severe AMS). Risk rewarded, heroism creative functional, protocols
    evolved experience. Altitude humbled Daniel, community saved, lessons transmitted.
    
    **Hybrid approach:** Daniel recovered mostly, returns marathon 2030 volunteer
    (medical tent, shares story runners, warnings personal authentic), collaboration
    medical/community strengthened (protocols adapted local knowledge, Dr. Sanchez/Marco
    co-train responders), altitude emergencies decreased (preparation better, response
    faster). Compromise effective sustainable, teamwork modeled, Mexican problem-solving
    validated. Altitude challenges persist, responses improved, community-medical
    partnership functional.
    
    **Community-led:** Daniel recovered fully, moves Mexico City permanently (altitude
    adaptation lifestyle, coaching runners acclimatization programs, gratitude life
    mission), local runners' knowledge institutionalized (marathon medical training
    includes indigenous/community wisdom, Rosa/Marco lead workshops), altitude medicine
    decolonized (protocols Western-based expanded local knowledge centuries-tested),
    emergencies rare (community vigilance, collective response, altitude respect cultural).
    Transformation personal systemic, local knowledge centered, community medicine
    effective, altitude teacher harshest kindest lessons learned. Daniel's hubris
    became humility, collapse became awakening, strangers became family. Mexico City
    altitude constant - locals adapted, visitors humbled, community catches falling.
    Thin air harsh teacher gentle healer community hands.
    
    Mexico City endures altitude eternal - 2,240m, thin air, oxygen scarce, lungs
    working harder, hearts pounding faster, visitors struggling, locals thriving,
    athletes humbled, physiology absolute. Marathon continues annually, runners arrive
    early warned, altitude respected feared loved, medical tents ready, community
    watching, strangers helping strangers. Daniel's story one thousands, collapse
    reminded everyone: Altitude indifferent credentials, physiology absolute willpower,
    community survives individuals perish alone, Mexico City sky closer gravity heavier
    bonds stronger. Popocatépetl Iztaccíhuatl watch silent (volcanoes snow-capped
    ancient), Valley of Mexico breathes thin (2 million years geological, 700 years
    urban), CDMX thrives impossibly (22 million altitude, infrastructure straining,
    humanity persisting). City in clouds, people grounded, altitude humbles, community
    lifts. Run careful, breathe deep, listen body, trust strangers, respect sky. Mexico
    City teaches daily. Survivors learn. Daniel learned. Altitude forgave once.

    Altitude quest educational physiologically accurate. Mexico City 2,240m (7,350
    ft) real, oxygen ~25% less sea level correct, AMS/HACE symptoms accurate medical.
    Marathon real established 1983, 25K+ runners, altitude notorious 10-15% slower
    times documented. Daniel's collapse realistic - insufficient acclimatization 2
    days (needs 10-14), aggressive pace altitude recipe disaster, HACE progression
    rapid severe cases. Medical protocols real: Oxygen, descent, dexamethasone, CT
    scan ICU. Rosa's wisdom reflects real altitude communities - generational knowledge,
    descent sacred, pride kills documented. Marco's creative descent medically controversial
    але physiologically sound (descent reduces altitude immediately partial pressure
    increases). Four paths represent real emergency response tensions: Protocols safe
    але rigid sometimes slow, creative solutions risky але effective sometimes, collaboration
    functional sustainable, community wisdom centuries-tested valuable. Quest doesn't
    prescribe BUT community-led path rewarded highest (XP 18K, reputation 7K, achievement)
    - authorial stance values local knowledge decolonized medicine. Educational altitude
    physiology (atmospheric pressure, oxygen partial pressure, acclimatization red
    blood cells), AMS/HACE symptoms progression treatment, Mexico City geography (Valley
    of Mexico, Popocatépetl Iztaccíhuatl volcanoes). Respectful medical professionals
    (Dr. Sanchez cautious reasonable, protocols exist reasons), local knowledge (Rosa
    wisdom valid, Marco instinct correct), Daniel hubris human universal (overconfidence
    youth invincibility, humility learned suffering). Heavy theme (life-death stakes)
    balanced hope (community saves, lessons learned, transformation possible). Marathon
    metaphor life - pace matters, listen body, respect limits, community catches falling.
    Mexico City altitude constant protagonist silent powerful - indifferent credentials,
    absolute physiology, humbles everyone eventually, forgives learned. Tone urgent
    compassionate educational. 50-minute duration justified emergency complexity medical
    detail community dynamics. Altitude teacher harshest kindest. Breathe careful.
    Run humble. Trust community. Respect sky. Mexico City teaches daily.
