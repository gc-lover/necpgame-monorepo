summary:
  brief: |
    South Beach. Neon nights, Instagram dreams, Art Deco ghosts. Reality за фильтрами?
  
  description: |
    Miami South Beach - Art Deco district, pastel buildings, neon signs, Ocean Drive.
    Instagram paradise. Influencer capital. But beneath surface - gentrification,
    locals priced out, culture commodified, authenticity dying. Pretty facade, hollow interior.
    
    July 2025 - mega-influencer Valentina Rose (10M followers) rents entire hotel
    block South Beach для "Neon Dreams Festival" - exclusive event, luxury brands,
    celebrity performances, content creation paradise. Tickets $5K minimum. Locals locked out.
    
    Simultaneously - community activists led by Abuela Garcia (78, 50 years South Beach)
    protest. "Our neighborhood! Not playground rich tourists! We're erased photos!"
    
    You're photographer hired document festival. But встречаешь Abuela's granddaughter
    Lucia - shows you real South Beach, за neon. Communities struggling, history
    forgotten, identity lost. Choose side: Content dream или authentic truth?

  goal: |
    Document Neon Dreams Festival OR expose reality за spectacle. Влиятельность
    или integrity. Instagram content или real journalism.

  essence: |
    Social commentary через Miami nightlife lens. Influencer culture critique. Gentrification
    tangible. Photography choice gameplay. Light но pointed. Cyperpunk aesthetics
    meets real social issues.

story:
  background: |
    South Beach 1920s-30s - Art Deco paradise built. 1970s-80s - decline, crime, decay.
    1990s - revival, preservation, tourism boom. 2010s-20s - Instagram era, influencer
    invasion, gentrification extreme. Locals pushed out, culture superficial. Beautiful
    corpse.

  opening: |
    Thursday evening, Ocean Drive. Neon signs glowing, palm trees silhouetted, pastel
    buildings perfect backdrop. Valentina's team setting festival - stages, branded
    installations, "Instagrammable" spots everywhere. Money evident.
    
    Valentina herself (26, perfectly styled): "Darling! You're photographer! Perfect!
    Capture magic - happy people, beautiful lights, brands subtly visible. Make
    South Beach look DREAM. Authentic, но glamorous. Understand?"
    
    Contradiction obvious. But pays $10K week. Follow festival, shoot content,
    deliver fantasy. Easy money.
    
    First night shoot - influencers posing, champagne flowing, music thumping. Everything
    perfect, polished, fake. Through viewfinder - beautiful. But feels... empty.
    
    Break, wander side street. Encuentras protest - 30+ locals, signs: "South Beach
    FOR RESIDENTS", "No más gentrification", "Our HOME not Instagram".
    
    Abuela Garcia leading - tiny, fierce, passionate: "My family here 50 years!
    Built this community! Now rich people kick us out, make fancy photos, leave.
    We're invisible them!"
    
    Her granddaughter Lucia (23, community organizer) approaches: "You photographer?
    Festival?" Eyes judgmental. "Figures. Making us pretty prisoners our neighborhood."
    
    You explain job. She challenges: "Want real story? Come tomorrow morning. Show
    you South Beach they don't photograph."

  act_one: |
    **Choice emerges - two South Beaches**
    
    **South Beach A: Festival (Valentina's version)**
    
    Glamorous, exciting, perfect. Influencers perform joy, brands everywhere, content
    factory. Everything color-corrected, filtered, aspirational. Night scenes magical -
    neon reflecting, crowds dancing, life celebration appearing.
    
    Valentina loves your shots: "YES! This sells dream! People see Miami paradise!"
    Brands reshare. Your work trending. Career boost huge.
    
    But notice: Same spots photographed 1000 times. Same poses. Same fake smiles.
    Repetition soul-crushing. Beauty manufactured, not discovered.
    
    **South Beach B: Reality (Lucia's version)**
    
    Morning. Follow Lucia. Different world. Elderly Cubans playing dominoes cafés.
    Workers commuting service jobs. Families struggling rent increases. Shops closing -
    replaced luxury boutiques. Community fading.
    
    Abuela Garcia's apartment - rent $3200/month, was $800 five years ago. Fixed
    income $1400. Impossible math. "Next month, evicted probably. 50 years, doesn't
    matter. Building owner wants Airbnb units."
    
    Document это: Real people, real struggle, real Miami dying. Photos powerful,
    uncomfortable, true. Nobody wants see. Not "Instagrammable". But important.
    
    **Dual assignment conflict**
    
    Festival wants fantasy continuation. Lucia wants truth exposed. Cannot do both -
    fundamentally opposed visions. Choose.

  act_two: |
    **Path A: Continue festival (Fantasy)**
    
    Commit content creation. Valentina's brand activations, celebrity appearances,
    sponsored posts. Make everything gorgeous. Festival success. Brands thrilled.
    Payment guaranteed. Reputation as "Miami lifestyle photographer" established.
    
    But ignore protesters. Don't attend eviction defense. Skip community meeting.
    Focus money, career, beauty. Practical choice. Survival first.
    
    Festival week ends. Everyone leaves. South Beach returns "normal" - gentrified,
    expensive, locals fewer. Your photos circulate millions impressions. "Miami
    dreams!" captions. Reality hidden successfully.
    
    Lucia sees your work online. Messages: "You chose. Money over truth. Expected.
    Disappointing still." Blocked.
    
    Success tastes hollow somewhat. But bank account healthy. Justify easily.
    
    **Path B: Document truth (Journalism)**
    
    Tell Valentina you're covering "fuller story". She furious: "Contract breach!
    Want fired?" Possibly. But integrity matters.
    
    Spend week both sides - festival nights (document superficiality), community
    days (document struggle). Contrast stark. Create photo essay: "Two South Beaches:
    Paradise Lost".
    
    Show:
    - Influencer posing perfectly vs elderly Cuban evicted
    - Champagne bottles $500 vs families skipping meals
    - "Glamorous Miami!" posts vs "Rent Due" notices
    - Neon signs glowing vs community centers closing
    
    Raw, powerful, true. Submit major publications. Some reject - "too depressing".
    Miami Herald runs it. Local news covers. Social media shares organic, meaningful.
    
    Valentina threatens lawsuit. Brands blacklist you. Festival payment withheld.
    Financial hit harsh. But community gratitude immense. Lucia hugs crying: "You
    saw us. Thank you."
    
    Abuela Garcia's eviction temporarily stopped - publicity pressured landlord
    negotiate. Small victory. Doesn't solve gentrification, но fighting matters.

  act_three: |
    **Consequences - different endings**
    
    **Ending A: Influencer photographer**
    
    Career flourishes. Brands hire constantly. Miami lifestyle photography niche.
    Wealthy clients, exotic locations, beautiful lies. Comfortable living.
    
    But emptiness grows. Every assignment same - make rich people pretty, hide
    problems, sell fantasy. Art becomes advertising. Soul commercialized.
    
    Years later, return South Beach. Abuela Garcia's building - luxury Airbnb now.
    Community gone. Your photos helped this - made displacement glamorous, gentrification
    desirable. Contribution к erasure.
    
    Success achieved. Meaning lost.
    
    **Ending B: Documentary photographer**
    
    Career harder. Influencer work dries up. Brands avoid. But journalism doors open.
    Publications hire social documentary. NGOs seek authentic storytelling. Work
    meaningful, pays less, но matters more.
    
    South Beach photo essay wins awards. Florida Press Association recognition.
    Community advocacy groups use images campaigns. Real impact - zoning law changes,
    rent control proposals, preservation efforts.
    
    Financial struggle continues. Але purpose clear. Art serves truth, not commerce.
    Legacy positive.
    
    Lucia becomes friend. Introduces other communities fighting displacement. Ongoing
    work documenting resistance. Not glamorous. Essential.
    
    **Ending C: Hybrid compromise**
    
    Shoot festival daytime (fulfill contract), community nights (personal project).
    Deliver Valentina's content, но publish separate photo essay. Diplomatic solution.
    
    Both sides somewhat satisfied, neither thrilled. Valentina gets usable content,
    withholds bonus. Community appreciates coverage, wishes exclusive focus.
    
    Balanced approach, pragmatic. Keeps options open. Less dramatic, more sustainable.
    Real-world navigation. Nobody martyr, nobody sellout. Just... trying.

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Social commentary quest. Miami gentrification real, severe. Influencer culture
    critique timely. Photography choice meaningful - fantasy vs truth different
    careers, different legacies. Documentary path more rewarding (XP, achievements)
    але financially harder - realistic. Hybrid path pragmatic. Abuela Garcia represents
    thousands displaced. Lucia millennial activist voice. Valentina not villain -
    just oblivious privilege. Cyberpunk aesthetics (neon, wealth gap, commodified
    culture) через real social issues. Light combat, heavy conscience.
