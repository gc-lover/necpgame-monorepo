summary:
  brief: |
    Little Havana. Three generations Cubans. One dream - different meanings.
  
  description: |
    Little Havana, Miami - Cuban exile heartland. 1960s, fled Castro regime, brought
    culture, dreams, trauma. Built community. Waited 60+ years "return" to Cuba.
    Never happened. Instead - raised generations между двумя мирами.
    
    March 2026 - patriarch Abuelo Roberto Rodriguez (82) dying. Cancer, weeks left.
    Final wish: Family decides future café "El Sueño Cubano" (The Cuban Dream).
    Three generations, три visions:
    
    - Roberto (82): Preserve exactly as is. Museum Cuban culture pre-revolution.
    Nostalgia frozen time.
    - Miguel (53, son): Modernize, expand, franchise. Make sustainable business.
    Adapt или die.
    - Isabela (26, granddaughter): Transform social justice space. Serve community,
    not profit. Radical change.
    
    You're family friend, asked mediate. Navigate generational trauma, identity
    conflicts, impossible compromises. Café metaphor larger Cuban-American experience.
    Preserve past? Adapt present? Transform future?

  goal: |
    Help Rodriguez family decide café fate. Understand three perspectives. Mediate
    compromise или choose side. Legacy, identity, survival stakes.

  essence: |
    Intimate family drama через Cuban-American lens. Generational divide universal.
    No combat, pure dialogue. Educational about exile experience. Emotionally heavy,
    beautifully human.

story:
  background: |
    1959 - Cuban Revolution. Castro takeover. Elite и middle-class fled - "gusanos"
    (worms) revolutionaries called them. Arrived Miami nothing, built Little Havana.
    Maintained Spanish, culture, dreamed return. Never did. Frozen nostalgia community.
    
    Children born Miami - Cuban identity, American reality. Straddled both. Grandchildren -
    American primarily, Cuban heritage ancestral. Identity dilutes, conflicts emerge.
    Who "real" Cuban? Who decides tradition?

  opening: |
    Sunday afternoon, El Sueño Cubano. Small café, Calle Ocho. Cuban coffee, croquetas,
    domino tables, photos 1950s Habana walls. Time capsule perfect. Roberto's life work.
    
    Family gathered. Roberto frail, hospitalbed corner café. Wants die there, surrounded
    his dream. Calls meeting:
    
    "Familia. My time short. Café - everything I preserved. Culture, memory, Cuba
    as was. Beautiful, free, before... darkness. Cannot let die. Decide together -
    who takes over, how continues. Por favor. Last wish."
    
    Miguel steps forward: "Papá, I love café. But honest? Struggling. Rent increasing,
    customers aging, young Cubans don't come. Need modernize - Instagram-friendly
    decor, expanded menu, maybe franchising. Or closes в year. Business reality."
    
    Isabela interrupts: "Abuelo, café beautiful. But also... monument exile trauma.
    What if transform? Community center. Mutual aid hub. Serve immigrants, refugees,
    marginalized. Social justice space. Cuba fought oppression - why not continue
    fight here?"
    
    Roberto's face... conflicted. Pride Miguel's practicality. Fear Isabela's radicalism.
    Sadness both miss point - preservation is the goal. But unsustainable.
    
    He looks you: "Viejo amigo. Help them understand. Or help me understand. Something.
    Please."
    
    Heavy responsibility.

  act_one: |
    **Understanding Roberto - The Patriarch**
    
    Spend afternoon Roberto, listening stories. 1958 Habana - music, elegance, freedom
    (for some). Revolution arrived, excitement turned fear. Fled overnight, single
    suitcase. Left everything.
    
    "Imagine - your entire world, gone. Not destroyed - stolen. Changed. Place you
    loved, made unrecognizable. Painful beyond words. So here -" gestures café, "-
    I kept it. Real Habana. Memory sacred. If change... like accepting loss final.
    Cannot. Not while alive."
    
    Tears stream. Trauma raw даже 65 years later. Café not business - grief sanctuary.
    Preservation desperate act holding past.
    
    Understand: Modernizing feels erasing. For him, that's death culture. Cannot
    accept.
    
    **Understanding Miguel - The Son**
    
    Evening, Miguel's home. Successful lawyer, comfortable life. But café - burden
    and love.
    
    "Father never let go Cuba. Understand why. Але I grew here. Miami my home. Cuba -
    ancestral, important, но not my country. I'm American. Cuban-American. Difference
    matters.
    
    Café beautiful memorial. But memorial not viable business. Customers dying -
    literally, old exiles passing. Young Cubans want modern spaces, не nostalgia
    museums. Preserve café exactly? Closes в 2 years. Then what? Nothing left.
    
    Franchising sounds crass. But survival. Adapt tradition, make accessible, generate
    income preserve core. Better imperfect continuation than perfect extinction.
    
    Father sees betrayal. I see practical love. Can't make him understand. Hurts."
    
    Pragmatist, но conflicted. Wants honor father, but survive. Impossible balance.
    
    **Understanding Isabela - The Granddaughter**
    
    Night, protest march (housing rights). Isabela there, passionate. Afterwards,
    talk:
    
    "Abuelo's Cuba? Honestly? Didn't exist. Pre-revolution Cuba - beautiful for elite.
    Poor suffered. Revolution happened reason. Flawed? Yes. But necessary.
    
    Exile community romanticizes pre-Castro Cuba. Forgets inequality, oppression,
    corruption. Café preserves sanitized memory. Not truth.
    
    What if honor real Cuban spirit? Resistance. Solidarity. Community. Transform
    café - free food

 programs, ESL classes, immigration help, organizing space.
    Serve people, not nostalgia.
    
    Radical? Yes. But revolutionary - like Abuelo's generation was, ironically.
    They fled revolution, but were revolutionaries escaping. I continue that spirit,
    differently.
    
    He'll hate it. Але maybe hate better than irrelevance."
    
    Idealistic, confrontational, але thoughtful. Represents generational break, new
    Cuban-American identity.

  act_two: |
    **Family meeting - mediation attempt**
    
    Next evening. All gathered. You facilitate discussion. Tensions high.
    
    **Roberto:** "Café stays as is. No changes. Sacred."
    
    **Miguel:** "Then fails в year. Papá, reality!"
    
    **Isabela:** "Both wrong. Museum OR business - missing point!"
    
    Yelling escalates. Old wounds opened - Miguel's corporate career "betraying
    culture", Isabela's activism "disrespecting sacrifice", Roberto's rigidity "controlling
    from grave". Family trauma raw.
    
    You intervene: Options explored?
    
    **Option A: Pure preservation (Roberto's wish)**
    
    Keep café identical. Apply heritage grants, nonprofit status, volunteer-run.
    Museum model. Educates, preserves, но limited community engagement. Roberto
    dies happy. Café survives barely, possibly closes eventually. Frozen perfection.
    
    **Option B: Modernization (Miguel's plan)**
    
    Renovate tastefully. Keep Cuban core, add contemporary elements. Franchise 2-3
    locations. Sustainable business. Roberto heartbroken change. Café survives, transformed.
    Identity diluted somewhat. Pragmatic success.
    
    **Option C: Community center (Isabela's vision)**
    
    Radical transformation. Social justice hub. Mutual aid, organizing, free services.
    Nonprofit, donation-based. Serves marginalized. Roberto potentially devastated.
    Café becomes something new. Revolutionary spirit, different form.
    
    **Option D: Hybrid compromise**
    
    Keep café main room preserved exactly (Roberto satisfied). Add back room -
    community programs, modern events (Isabela somewhat happy). Franchise other
    locations с adapted model (Miguel's business viable). Nobody fully happy, everyone
    partially satisfied. Messy compromise. Real families work.
    
    **Option E: Let die with Roberto**
    
    Close café when he dies. Perfect memorial ends cleanly. No further conflict.
    Family sells building, moves on. Roberto's wish honored через ending, not continuation.
    Sad але dignified. Some things не meant last forever.
    
    Family must decide. You guide, not impose. Heavy choice.

  act_three: |
    **Roberto's final days - acceptance journey**
    
    Week later. Roberto's condition worsens. Knows death imminent. Calls you privately:
    
    "I listened. My children, grandchildren. Love them. But afraid - afraid everything
    I saved, lost. Cuba lost twice - once revolution, once forgetting. Terrifying.
    
    But maybe... maybe holding too tight. Miguel wants café survive - that's love,
    different form. Isabela wants honor Cuban spirit - that's remembering, radically.
    Both love Cuba, just... their Cuba. Not mine. Okay?
    
    Hard accept. But what choice? Control from grave? No. Trust family. Trust maybe
    café changes, але something remains. Memory, spirit, love. Enough.
    
    Tell them - choose together. My blessing, whatever decide. Even" - pauses, tears,
    "- даже close. Because chose together, with love. That's Cuban también."
    
    Profound moment. Releasing control, trusting legacy.
    
    **Resolution - family chooses**
    
    Final meeting. You relay Roberto's blessing. Tension shifts - no longer defying
    father, но honoring через deciding.
    
    Miguel і Isabela talk, really talk. Common ground emerges:
    
    "What if - main café preserved much as possible, heritage site. But add community
    programs Isabela wants, funded через modest franchising I plan? Hybrid. Messy.
    Але together."
    
    Isabela nods: "Not perfect. Але honors Abuelo's preservation AND serves community.
    Can work with that."
    
    Compromise reached. Imperfect, real. Roberto smiles hearing: "Bueno. Together.
    That's family. That's Cuba."
    
    Days later - Roberto dies peacefully. Café surrounds him. Family united grief,
    но also plan. Legacy continues, transformed, alive.

  epilogue: |
    Year later. El Sueño Cubano thrives. Main room preserved - photos, dominoes,
    Cuban coffee traditional. Back room - ESL classes, community dinners, organizing
    meetings. Two franchise locations fund operations.
    
    Not Roberto's original vision. Not Miguel's pure business. Not Isabela's full
    radicalism. Something new. Cuban-American - hybrid, evolving, between worlds.
    
    Miguel manages business. Isabela directs community programs. Both honor Roberto
    через continuing, differently.
    
    Little Havana changes. Gentrification pressure, identity evolution, generations
    shift. Café adapts. Legacy - not frozen museum, living community. Cuban dream
    continues, redefined cada generation.
    
    Sometimes nostalgia must surrender hope. That's also love.

    Intimate family story representing larger Cuban-American experience. All perspectives

    beautifully human. Roberto's acceptance arc key - control released, trust given.
    Café metaphor identity negotiation all immigrant communities. Dialogue-heavy,
    no combat. Character-driven deeply. Cuban culture respectfully portrayed.
