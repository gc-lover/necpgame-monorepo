summary:
  brief: |
    One last job. Easy money. Or escape route. Miami's drug trade offers both.

  description: |
    Miami 2027 - drug gateway Americas. Cartels, smugglers, Coast Guard, DEA. Eternal
    cat-mouse game. Некоторые делают fortune. Most end prison или dead. Few get out.

    Carlos Reyes (38) - former smuggler, trying quit. 5 years clean, legit trucking
    business, raising daughter Maria (16) alone. Past buried. Future possible.

    Then visit from Diego Sanchez - old crew boss. One job offer: $500K run. Speed
    boat, 200kg cocaine, Bahamas к Keys. "In out, 4 hours, set for life. Or refuse -
    cartels don't забывают old debts."

    Carlos panics - cannot refuse без endangering Maria. Cannot accept без losing everything
    built. Ищет you - old friend, neutral party. Needs help: Run job safely OR find way
    out OR expose cartel риск arrests.

    Choose path: Easy money, hard redemption, или dangerous exposure. Carlos's life,
    Maria's future - твои hands. Miami Vice wasn't glamorous. This neither.

  goal: |
    Help Carlos: Complete drug run safely OR Find escape from cartel OR Expose cartel
    cooperate with DEA. Каждый choice different risks, rewards, consequences.

  essence: |
    Moral choice quest. Drug trade реальность, not glamour. Family stakes, redemption
    theme. No good options - least bad. Combat possible, not required. Heavy consequences.

story:
  background: |
    Miami drug trade history: 1980s cocaine cowboys, Pablo Escobar connections, Miami
    Vice era. 2020s - more sophisticated, less flashy. Cartels corporate, smuggling
    tech-heavy, violence strategic. But stakes same - money, prison, death.

    Carlos 2015-2022 - smuggler Diego's crew. Made money, lived dangerous. 2022 daughter
    Maria's mother OD'd. Wake-up call. Carlos quit, went legit. Diego let him - rare.
    But debts remembered.

  opening: |
    Thursday evening, Carlos's apartment, Kendall. Modest, clean, photos Maria everywhere.
    Carlos shaking, scared: "Gracias coming. No puedo handle alone."

    Explains: Diego visited yesterday. Cartel losing key smuggler (arrested). Need
    replacement one run. Carlos's skills, experience, conoce routes. Offer: $500K,
    clean slate. Refusal: "Remember Maria. Beautiful girl. 16. Careful age."

    Threat implicit, clear. Maria targeted если Carlos refuses. But run means риск
    everything - arrest 20 years, violence if double-crossed, Maria orphaned если wrong.

    "No good options. Run, maybe survive, live guilt. Refuse, maybe María hurt. Expose,
    definitely die. But you - outside. Maybe see options I can't. Please. Help."

    Desperate father. Impossible situation. What now?

    **Option assessment:**

    **Run successfully:** High risk, high reward. Complete safely - $500K split, Carlos
    free, María safe. But: Coast Guard patrols, DEA stings, cartel betrayal possible,
    moral guilt permanent.

    **Find escape:** Negotiate с Diego, witness protection, relocate María, new identities.
    Requires leverage, timing, cooperation multiple agencies. Complex, dangerous, но
    clean slate possible.

    **Expose cartel:** Cooperate DEA, wire up, gather evidence, sting operation. Heroic,
    dangerous, но cartel destroyed. Risk: leaks, retaliation, María endangered before arrest.

    Choose approach. Clock ticking - run scheduled Saturday night, 48 hours.

  act_one: |
    **Path A: Prepare run**

    Decide: Safest approach complete job, take money, disappear. Needs preparation.

    Meet Diego - Coconut Grove marina. Smooth, dangerous: "Carlos. Good see you. Thinking
    smart. Run simple - meet boat Bimini, transfer cargo, deliver Elliott Key, collect
    payment. Easy."

    Details suspicious: Too easy. Why Carlos specifically? Why now? Paranoia justified -
    drug trade full betrayals.

    Recon:
    - Speedboat check - mechanics, GPS, hidden trackers?
    - Route planning - Coast Guard schedules, weather, backup plans
    - Cargo verification - actual cocaine, или setup?
    - Payment guarantee - escrow, trusted third party, или cartel "trust"?

    Discover: Run legitimate, але danger real. Coast Guard increased patrols (someone
    tipped?), boat slightly damaged (sabotage или neglect?), payment half upfront only.

    Prep anyway. Saturday night approaches.

    **Path B: Negotiate escape**

    Approach Diego directly: "What if Carlos has better offer? Different value?"

    Diego intrigued: "What offer?" Propose: Carlos helps cartel different way - logistics
    consulting, legal cover businesses, routes planning. No hands-on smuggling. Safer,
    still valuable.

    Diego considers... refuses: "Bosses want Carlos prove loyalty. One run. Then maybe
    other arrangements. Но first, show trust."

    Alternative: Contact DEA Agent Sarah Mitchell - Carlos's old handler (tried flip
    him 2022, failed). Explain situation. She offers witness protection: Full testimony,
    cartel takedown, Carlos+María new identities, relocation.

    Cost: Carlos wears wire Saturday, records Diego, exposes network. Dangerous. But
    witness protection real if survives.

    **Path C: Expose operation**

    Decide: Only way María truly safe - cartel destroyed. Contact DEA directly.

    Agent Mitchell eager: "Carlos cooperates fully? We take down Diego's entire network.
    WITSEC guaranteed."

    Plan: Carlos wears wire, meets Diego, discusses run details. You backup - hidden
    surveillance, safety. Saturday night sting - arrest whole crew mid-run. Clean.

    Risk: Leaks, cartel discovers wire, retaliation before arrests. Need perfect execution.

  act_two: |
    **Saturday night - action**

    **Scenario A: The run**

    11 PM, Marina. Speedboat ready, Carlos nervous, you co-pilot. Open water, moonlit,
    beautiful, tense.

    Navigate Biscayne Bay, head Bahamas. 90 minutes open ocean. Halfway - Coast Guard
    cutter appears. Searchlights. Radio: "Vessel, stop immediately!"

    Choice: Stop (arrested), evade (chase, danger), radio malfunction (play dumb,
    stall). Choose evade - high-speed chase. Outrun? Engine skills tested. Success -
    lose tail. Failure - boarded, arrested, 20 years.

    Assume success. Arrive Bimini - cartel boat waiting. Transfer cargo. Smooth. Return
    Elliott Key. Delivery point - Diego waiting, cash briefcase.

    Then twist: Police lights. Ambush. Diego's setup - eliminate Carlos, keep money,
    frame dead smuggler. Betrayal expected, але painful.

    Firefight. Survive, escape, or negotiate. Hard choices under fire.

    **Scenario B: Escape route**

    Carlos wired, meets Diego, gets run details. You monitoring nearby. Conversation
    recorded. Evidence solid.

    Suddenly - Diego suspicious: "Carlos, you nervous. Why?" Hand moves gun. Tense moment.

    Carlos improves: "Daughter. Scared for her. That's all." Diego relaxes somewhat.
    Continues. Wire captures everything.

    Saturday approach - DEA ready, SWAT positioned. Carlos goes marina as planned. You
    shadow. Diego arrives, full crew. Discussion final details.

    Signal - DEA moves. Arrests fast, professional. Diego, crew, cartel contacts -
    all grabbed. No shots fired. Clean.

    Carlos safe. María safe. Witness protection processed.

    **Scenario C: Sting operation**

    Full cooperation DEA. Saturday - underwater surveillance team, air support, multi-agency
    taskforce. Carlos proceeds run normally, you ride-along, all monitored.

    Meet Diego marina. Wired conversation. Proceed boat. Open water - Coast Guard "happens"
    patrol nearby, doesn't intervene (coordinated). Reach Bimini, cartel boat appears.

    Transfer moment - all agencies strike simultaneously. Coast Guard, DEA, Bahamian
    police. Massive bust. 200kg cocaine, Carlos+Diego "arrested" (cover), crew real arrests.

    Later - Carlos+María extracted witness protection. Diego network destroyed. Major
    victory drug war. Rare.

  act_three: |
    **Consequences - different endings**

    **Ending A: Run successful (if survived)**

    Escape firefight, take cash, flee. $500K split. Carlos+María disappear - Mexico,
    Central America, new identities unofficial. Live paranoid, але alive. Guilt permanent -
    enabled drug trade, endangered daughter, dirty money. But María safe, future possible.
    Legacy complicated.

    Diego eventually caught separately, doesn't snitch (code). Carlos's involvement
    buried. Lucky, not proud.

    **Ending B: Run failed (arrested)**

    Caught Coast Guard, или Diego's ambush. Carlos arrested, 20 years federal. María
    foster care, devastated. You possibly arrested too depending involvement. Worst outcome.
    Carlos destroys everything trying protect daughter. Tragedy.

    **Ending C: Witness protection**

    DEA sting successful. Carlos testifies, Diego network dismantled. Carlos+María
    relocated - new names, new state, new lives. Boring, safe, clean. María graduates
    high school away Miami, never knows danger додивилась. Carlos finds peace - did
    right thing, hard way. Redemption real.

    You thanked DEA, maybe consultant fee. Clean conscience.

    **Ending D: Exposure backfires**

    Wire discovered, або leak. Cartel retaliates before arrests. Carlos possibly killed,
    María endangered. Tragic failure. Good intentions insufficient. Drug war brutal,
    mistakes lethal. Lesson learned harshly.

    Sometimes heroes lose. Reality not fair.

  epilogue: |
    Miami drug trade continues. Carlos's story barely blip. Thousands similar situations
    yearly. Some choose money, some redemption, some caught middle. No easy answers.

    María - future depends path chosen. Best outcome: Safe, elsewhere, knows father
    fought protect her. Worst: Orphaned, traumatized, cycle continues.

    Drug war не glamorous. Families destroyed, hard choices, messy consequences. Miami
    beautiful city, dark underbelly. Both real simultaneously.

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Heavy moral quest. Drug trade shown realistically - not glamorous, desperate,
    destructive. Carlos sympathetic - trapped, trying protect daughter, past catching
    up. No perfect choices. Witness protection path most rewarding - redemption real,
    карте destroyed, family safe. Run path tempting (money!) але guilt, danger, corruption.
    Failed paths possible - arrest, death, tragedy. Stakes high, consequences permanent.
    María never NPC met directly - keeps her innocent, symbolic. Diego not cartoon
    villain - dangerous professional. DEA not heroes necessarily - participants flawed
    system. Nuanced, dark, но human. Not glorifying drugs - showing reality, hard choices,
    family love through impossible situations. Combat optional, moral weight unavoidable.
