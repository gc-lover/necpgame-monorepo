summary:
  brief: |
    Walls speak truth. Murals scream resistance. Gentrification paints over both.
  
  description: |
    Wynwood 2024 - graffiti mecca America. Old warehouses, colorful murals, hipster
    galleries. Art-First District designation 2013 changed everything. Property values
    exploded. Artists priced out. Culture sold to tourists.
    
    Maya Rodriguez (29) - muralist, activist, Wynwood native. Grew up spraycans, saw
    neighborhood transform. Her latest mural - "The Cost of Cool" - political statement
    against gentrification: faceless developers bulldozing colorful community.
    
    Problem: Real estate mogul Richard Sterling bought entire block, including Maya's
    mural wall. Plans luxury condos, "authentic Wynwood experience" marketing. Мурал
    in way. Wants removed, wall sandblasted clean. Offers Maya money - commission
    "acceptable" piece новый building lobby. Sanitized, commercialized, neutered.
    
    Maya refused. Sterling получил court order - мурал "vandalism," removal legal.
    Demolition scheduled one week. Maya desperate: Save мурал OR expose Sterling's
    corruption OR create bigger statement through destruction.
    
    You - friend, former street artist, know both sides. Cultural preservation vs
    property rights. Art vs commerce. Wynwood soul at stake.

  goal: |
    Help Maya: Preserve mural legally OR Expose Sterling corruption stop demolition
    OR Use destruction create movement. Save Wynwood identity or let evolution happen.

  essence: |
    Social commentary quest. Gentrification reality, art commodification, community
    identity loss. No villains - Sterling lawful, Maya right principle. Difficult
    choices, urban change inevitable, resistance meaningful but often futile. Nuanced.

story:
  background: |
    Wynwood history: 1950s-70s Puerto Rican neighborhood, garment district. 1980s decline,
    crime, abandonment. 2000s Tony Goldman vision - "Wynwood Walls" project brought
    world-class street artists. 2010s explosion - galleries, restaurants, developers.
    
    Art-First District 2013: Protected murals legally, attracted investment, increased
    rents. Success curse - artists moved out, replaced tech bros и tourists. "Wynwood
    effect" - art gentrification catalyst, then victim. Cycle familiar Miami: Little
    Haiti next target.
    
    Maya family three generations Wynwood. Grandfather worked garment factory, father
    owned bodega (sold 2021, couldn't afford rent). Maya stayed - murals her resistance,
    documentation disappearing culture. "The Cost of Cool" her masterwork - 40-foot
    wall, six months work, community funded. Controversial, beautiful, true.

  opening: |
    Saturday morning, Wynwood. You meet Maya - spray paint-stained, exhausted, angry.
    She shows wall: Vibrant explosion color, dancing figures, dollar signs crushing
    them. Powerful.
    
    "They're killing us with art. Killing art with money. This wall - last real thing
    in Wynwood. Sterling wants gone. Next week, sandblasted. Then condos: 'Wynwood
    Lofts - Live Where Art Happens.' Bullshit. Art's already dead if we let him win."
    
    Shows court order: Legal, enforceable. Sterling owns wall, clear title. Мурал
    created without permission (technically). Removal его право. Maya's defense weak
    legally - strong morally.
    
    "I can't fight lawyers. Can't afford same. Need different approach. You understand
    both worlds - street and system. Help me. Not for me - for Wynwood. What's left of it."
    
    Options clear: Legal fight (long shot), expose Sterling (risky), performance art
    destruction (dramatic but permanent loss), или accept defeat (preservation through
    documentation).

  act_one: |
    **Path A: Legal preservation**
    
    Research: Wynwood Walls designation, landmark status, cultural heritage laws. Consult
    lawyer - pro bono artist rights advocate Jessica Martinez.
    
    Jessica realistic: "Legally weak. Sterling owns property. Мурал unauthorized.
    But - we can argue cultural significance, community value, First Amendment. Delay
    demolition, publicity pressure. Maybe force compromise."
    
    File injunction: Hearing scheduled 5 days. Need evidence: Community support
    (petitions, protests), art historical value (expert testimony), economic impact
    (tourism studies). Gather quickly.
    
    Organize community: Wynwood artists rally. Petition 5000 signatures 48 hours.
    Art Professor Columbia testifies Maya's significance. Tourism board data: Wynwood
    contributes $100M annually. Murals key.
    
    Hearing tense. Sterling's lawyers strong: Property rights absolute, мурал vandalism,
    cultural arguments irrelevant legally. Jessica counters: Public interest, cultural
    preservation, First Amendment expression.
    
    Judge sympathetic але hands tied: "Ms. Rodriguez, your work beautiful. But law
    clear - property owner права paramount. Injunction denied. However - recommend
    mediation. Compromise possible."
    
    **Path B: Expose corruption**
    
    Investigate Sterling's dealings. Something smells wrong - too aggressive, too fast.
    Dig deeper: Tax records, permit applications, zoning board meetings.
    
    Discover: Sterling's development violated zoning codes. Falsified environmental
    impact reports. Bribed building inspector (evidence weak але suggestive). Bigger:
    Tied to offshore accounts, possible money laundering Miami shell companies.
    
    Confront Sterling privately: "Your development illegal. Environmental fraud. Corruption.
    I have evidence. Drop demolition, or Miami Herald gets everything." Risky - Sterling
    dangerous если cornered.
    
    Sterling's response varies: If bluff called, destroys Maya faster. If evidence
    solid, negotiates: "Keep quiet, keep your wall. Plus $50K. Deal?" Dirty money,
    clean outcome.
    
    Alternative: Go public immediately. Herald investigates, exposé published. Sterling
    project halted, investigations launched. Mural saved! But - Maya becomes target.
    Sterling's lawyers sue defamation. Legal battles, stress, danger. Heroic але costly.
    
    **Path C: Performance art destruction**
    
    Maya's radical idea: "If wall dies, make death meaningful. Performance art - invite
    artists worldwide paint wall evening before demolition. 24-hour festival, live
    stream, document everything. Then - watch bulldozers. Broadcast destruction. Show
    world what gentrification really costs."
    
    Organize event: Guerrilla marketing, social media blitz. "Wynwood's Last Stand"
    becomes viral. Artists fly in globally - Banksy sends piece, Shepard Fairey participates
    virtually. Media descends.
    
    Night before: Wall transforms. Dozens artists, каждый adding layer. Live music,
    food trucks, thousands attend. Maya paints final piece center - hourglass, sand
    falling to "Sold" sign. Bittersweet, beautiful, defiant.
    
    Morning: Bulldozers arrive. Cameras rolling. Maya stands before wall: "This isn't
    ending. It's documentation. They can destroy art, но can't erase meaning. Wynwood's
    soul recorded forever. We move forward, keep creating, keep resisting."
    
    Demolition begins. Crowd watches silence. Wall crumbles. Livestream reaches millions.
    Hashtag #WynwoodWallsMatter trends globally. Cultural moment captured.

  act_two: |
    **Scenario A: Legal mediation**
    
    Judge-ordered mediation: Sterling, Maya, lawyers, mediator. Tense room.
    
    Mediator proposes compromises: Sterling allows mural remain temporarily (1 year),
    Maya documents professionally, then respectful removal. Or - Sterling commissions
    Maya new piece building lobby (controlled, sanitized). Or - Mural relocated different
    wall Sterling owns (expensive, imperfect).
    
    Negotiations difficult. Sterling wants control, Maya wants integrity. You mediate
    between extremes.
    
    Possible outcomes:
    - Maya accepts lobby commission: Compromised art, steady income, sold out feeling
    - Mural relocated: Partial preservation, different context, heavy costs
    - Temporary extension: Delay inevitable, documentation time, bittersweet
    - Deadlock: Back to demolition, legal fight continues, exhaustion
    
    **Scenario B: Corruption exposed**
    
    If kept quiet, took deal: Maya keeps wall, gets $50K, Sterling's crimes buried.
    Moral weight heavy - justice deferred, corruption rewarded. But practical win.
    
    If exposed publicly: Herald publishes. Sterling's empire investigated. Project
    halted months. Mural temporarily saved! But Sterling fights back viciously.
    
    Lawsuits filed: Defamation, invasion of privacy, tortious interference. Maya buried
    legal papers. Stress overwhelming. You possibly targeted too - accessory.
    
    Community rallies: Legal defense fund, pro bono support. Fight becomes symbol -
    David vs Goliath. Media sympathetic, public opinion swings Maya's favor.
    
    Months later: Sterling's corruption proven. Permits revoked, fines levied, possible
    criminal charges. Development cancelled. Victory! But cost huge - Maya's year lost
    to courts, stress, fear. Win expensive.
    
    **Scenario C: Destruction documented**
    
    Performance complete. Wall destroyed. Viral moment achieved. What now?
    
    Immediate aftermath: Global attention. Maya interviewed worldwide. Offers pour in -
    gallery shows, international commissions, book deals. Destruction became career
    maker ironically.
    
    Sterling's perspective: Initially angry. Then realizes - controversy increased
    condo values. "Wynwood Lofts - On Site of Famous Mural" marketing gold. Exploitation
    continues, different form.
    
    Community impact: Movement grows. "#SaveWynwood" becomes ongoing campaign. Other
    artists mobilize, document, resist. Cultural preservation initiatives funded.
    Maya's sacrifice inspired action.
    
    Personal cost: Maya hollow victory. Art destroyed, neighborhood still changing,
    gentrification unstoppable. But - message sent, movement started, legacy created.
    Bittersweet success.

  act_three: |
    **Ending A: Compromise achieved**
    
    Mediation produces deal: Mural stays 18 months, professionally documented, then
    respectfully removed. Digital archive public. Sterling funds Wynwood artist grant
    $100K annually. Maya uncomfortable але accepts.
    
    Months pass: Mural becomes tourist pilgrimage. Maya conflicted - sold out? или
    smart? Uses grant help other artists. Wynwood still gentrifies, але resistance
    funded now.
    
    Final day: Removal ceremony. Maya speaks: "Change inevitable. But we documented
    truth. Fought back. Next artists - your turn. Keep Wynwood weird." Bittersweet
    ending. Evolution acknowledged, resistance continued.
    
    **Ending B: Corruption defeated**
    
    Sterling's empire crumbles. Development cancelled. Mural saved permanently! Building
    designated historic landmark (ironic). Maya hero.
    
    Cost: Years legal battles, stress, exhaustion. Maya aged, hardened. Victory pyrrhic
    feeling. Wynwood still gentrifies - different developers, same result. Won battle,
    losing war.
    
    Personal growth: Maya transitions activism - organizes artists, fights permits,
    community advocate. Original art less, politics more. Necessary але sad. Artist
    became bureaucrat saving art.
    
    **Ending C: Destruction inspires movement**
    
    Wall gone, movement thriving. Maya international figure. Other cities adopt model -
    document, resist, document destruction, inspire change. "Wynwood model" spreads.
    
    Irony: Maya's success distances her community she fought for. Gallery shows New
    York, commissions Europe, книга bestseller. Gentrification's beneficiary despite
    fighting it. Uncomfortable truth.
    
    Wynwood continues changing. Some walls preserved now - city ordinance passed Maya's
    campaign. Small victory. Neighborhood demographics shift regardless. Art stays,
    artists leave. Hollow preservation.
    
    **Ending D: Acceptance and evolution**
    
    Maya chooses different path: Accepts wall removal, documents thoroughly, creates
    museum exhibition "Wynwood Before." Preserves memory, acknowledges change inevitability.
    
    Collaborates Sterling: Consults new development, ensures artistic elements authentic,
    not appropriative. Uneasy partnership ale productive. Guides evolution rather
    resisting futilely.
    
    Community mixed reactions: Some call sellout, others applaud pragmatism. Maya peace
    with choice: "Can't stop change. Can shape it. Make it better. Or disappear yelling."
    
    Years later: Wynwood Lofts feature Maya's lobby installation - "Evolution" piece
    documenting neighborhood transformation. Expensive apartments, affordable artist
    studios Sterling included (Maya demanded). Imperfect but practical.

  epilogue: |
    Gentrification doesn't have villains - only forces. Art bootstraps neighborhoods,
    attracts capital, prices out artists. Cycle repeats Miami, Brooklyn, Berlin, everywhere.
    Resistance noble but often futile. Compromise distasteful but survival mechanism.
    
    Maya's story common: Artist watches home transform, fights back, eventually overwhelmed
    or absorbed. Win or lose, neighborhood changes. Question isn't stop change - how
    honor past while enabling future.
    
    Wynwood Walls remain. Tourists photograph, Instagram, consume art sanitized. Original
    graffiti writers elsewhere now - Overtown, Liberty City, margins always. Art finds
    way. Always moves, always survives, different form.
    
    Player's choice: Idealism vs pragmatism, resistance vs compromise, documentation
    vs destruction. All valid, all costs. Urban development complex, morally ambiguous,
    deeply human.

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Gentrification quest - nuanced, no villains. Sterling lawful, Maya righteous,
    both limited options. Addresses real urban dynamics: art bootstraps neighborhoods,
    attracts capital, prices out creators. Cycle repeats globally. Player choices
    impact Maya's outcome але not stop inevitable change. Endings varied - compromise,
    resistance, documentation, acceptance. All valid, all costs. Performance destruction
    most dramatic - viral attention але permanent loss. Legal fight realistic - compromises,
    delays, exhaustion. Corruption path tempting але dangerous. Acceptance pragmatic
    але feels like surrender. No perfect solution reflects reality. Wynwood real place,
    real history, real ongoing transformation. Quest doesn't glorify resistance или
    justify development - shows complexity, human cost, difficult choices. Maya sympathetic
    but not perfect - her fight righteous але sometimes impractical. Sterling not
    evil - represents system, market forces, legal reality. Community divided reactions
    realistic - no consensus gentrification. Art documentation, cultural preservation
    through loss, evolution acknowledgment - mature themes. Player learns cities change,
    cultures adapt or disappear, resistance meaningful even if unsuccessful, compromise
    survival mechanism. Adult urban quest, socially aware, morally complex.
