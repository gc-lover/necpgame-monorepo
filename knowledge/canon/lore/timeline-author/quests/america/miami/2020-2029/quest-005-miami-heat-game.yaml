summary:
  brief: |
    One ticket. One game. Father-son bond through basketball, gambling debt threatening both.
  
  description: |
    Miami 2023, playoff season. Heat vs Celtics, Eastern Conference Finals Game 7. FTX
    Arena (still called that, crypto sponsorship not crashed yet). City electric, championship
    hopes high. Tickets expensive, scalpers everywhere, fans passionate.
    
    Marcus Johnson (47) - former college basketball player, career ended knee injury,
    works construction, loves Heat religiously. His son Tommy (19) - freshman University
    Miami, basketball scholarship, Heat fanatic like father. Bond entire life: Watch
    games together, analyze plays, dream championships.
    
    Problem: Marcus gambling addiction. Started innocent - friendly bets, office pools.
    Escalated 2020 online gambling boom. Now deep: $85K debt to bookmaker Vincent
    "Vinnie Cards" Moretti. Loan sharks circling. Vinnie demands payment one week,
    або consequences - violent, permanent.
    
    Marcus hid from Tommy. Shame, fear, desperation. Plan: Bet everything remaining
    Game 7 - Heat win, clears debt. Heat lose, disaster. Already sold house, car,
    possessions. One asset remains: Two courtside Game 7 tickets - lifetime dream,
    father-son experience, worth $10K each.
    
    Decision point: Marcus contacts you - old friend, neutral perspective. Tonight's
    game. Tommy expecting attend together (doesn't know addiction). Marcus must: Attend
    game with son, cherish moment OR Sell tickets, pay partial debt, survival priority
    OR Bet tickets outcome, Hail Mary desperation.
    
    You see Marcus broken, Tommy innocent, moment precious. Help navigate impossible choice.

  goal: |
    Help Marcus: Honor father-son tradition OR Survive gambling debt OR Find redemption
    path. Tommy's future, Marcus's life, one game decides everything.

  essence: |
    Redemption/consequences quest. Gambling addiction реальность, family bonds tested,
    impossible choices. Sports passion turned destructive. Father's love vs survival
    instinct. Moment vs future. Heartfelt, heavy, human.

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Emotional, heavy quest about gambling addiction реальность. Marcus sympathetic -
    loving father, mistake spiraled, desperate circumstances. Tommy innocent collateral,
    relationship core. Vinnie not villain - businessman, dangerous але not evil. Choices
    impossible - preserve moment або survive debt, gamble desperation або negotiate,
    confess або hide. Heat Game 7 backdrop perfect - sports love turned poison via
    addiction. Endings varied - redemption possible (payment plan, GA, honesty), tragedy
    possible (death, estrangement, bankruptcy). Player can't fix addiction directly -
    only help navigate crisis. Realistic portrayal: Addiction progressive disease,
    shame powerful barrier, family impact devastating, recovery requires honesty/help.

    Tommy's innocence contrasts Marcus's guilt poignantly. Basketball bond beautiful
    despite addiction taint. No perfect solutions - least destructive path varies
    player values. Attend game emotionally satisfying але dangerous. Sell tickets
    practical але hurts Tommy. Bet outcome gambling addict behavior - desperation
    logic. Negotiate smartest але long commitment. All consequences permanent - Marcus's
    recovery, Tommy's career, relationship trust. Adult quest, handles addiction
    respectfully, shows human cost gambling epidemic, emphasizes hope through honesty/recovery.
