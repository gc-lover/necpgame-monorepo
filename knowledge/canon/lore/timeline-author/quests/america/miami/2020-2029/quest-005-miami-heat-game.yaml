summary:
  brief: |
    One ticket. One game. Father-son bond through basketball, gambling debt threatening both.
  
  description: |
    Miami 2023, playoff season. Heat vs Celtics, Eastern Conference Finals Game 7. FTX
    Arena (still called that, crypto sponsorship not crashed yet). City electric, championship
    hopes high. Tickets expensive, scalpers everywhere, fans passionate.
    
    Marcus Johnson (47) - former college basketball player, career ended knee injury,
    works construction, loves Heat religiously. His son Tommy (19) - freshman University
    Miami, basketball scholarship, Heat fanatic like father. Bond entire life: Watch
    games together, analyze plays, dream championships.
    
    Problem: Marcus gambling addiction. Started innocent - friendly bets, office pools.
    Escalated 2020 online gambling boom. Now deep: $85K debt to bookmaker Vincent
    "Vinnie Cards" Moretti. Loan sharks circling. Vinnie demands payment one week,
    або consequences - violent, permanent.
    
    Marcus hid from Tommy. Shame, fear, desperation. Plan: Bet everything remaining
    Game 7 - Heat win, clears debt. Heat lose, disaster. Already sold house, car,
    possessions. One asset remains: Two courtside Game 7 tickets - lifetime dream,
    father-son experience, worth $10K each.
    
    Decision point: Marcus contacts you - old friend, neutral perspective. Tonight's
    game. Tommy expecting attend together (doesn't know addiction). Marcus must: Attend
    game with son, cherish moment OR Sell tickets, pay partial debt, survival priority
    OR Bet tickets outcome, Hail Mary desperation.
    
    You see Marcus broken, Tommy innocent, moment precious. Help navigate impossible choice.

  goal: |
    Help Marcus: Honor father-son tradition OR Survive gambling debt OR Find redemption
    path. Tommy's future, Marcus's life, one game decides everything.

  essence: |
    Redemption/consequences quest. Gambling addiction реальность, family bonds tested,
    impossible choices. Sports passion turned destructive. Father's love vs survival
    instinct. Moment vs future. Heartfelt, heavy, human.

story:
  background: |
    Marcus/Tommy relationship core: Basketball shared language. Marcus's injury 1997
    ended dreams - knee shattered senior year college, NBA scouts disappeared. Pain
    never left - physical, emotional. Transferred love Tommy - trained him young,
    supported scholarship, lived vicariously.
    
    Tommy excellent player: 6'3", shooting guard, UM starting lineup freshman year.
    Potential pro career. Marcus proud, hopeful, redeemed through son. Relationship
    healthy, loving, built mutual respect basketball foundation.
    
    Gambling addiction started gradual: 2015 lost job construction recession, finances
    tight. Small bets supplemented income occasionally. Won sometimes, felt control.
    2020 pandemic - isolation, online gambling exploded, Marcus spiraled. Losses mounted,
    chased losses, borrowed, lost more. Classic addiction cycle.
    
    Vinnie Moretti - not cartoon mobster. Professional bookmaker, runs clean operation
    mostly, але debt collection serious business. Gave Marcus extensions (Tommy's
    potential value), але patience exhausted. $85K substantial. Wants money або example
    made. Pragmatic, dangerous.

  opening: |
    Tuesday evening, 5 PM. Game tonight 8 PM. Marcus calls desperate: "Need talk.
    Urgent. Alone." Meet dingy diner, Marcus looks destroyed - unshaven, exhausted,
    shaking.
    
    Confession pours out: "$85K. Vinnie. One week. I'm dead if don't pay. Sold everything.
    Tickets left - courtside, Tommy's dream. Can sell $20K, partial payment. Or bet
    outcome, Heat win clears debt. Or...take Tommy, pretend everything fine, last
    good memory before...whatever happens."
    
    Shows tickets: Section 108, Row 1. Courtside. Tommy ecstatic about them weeks.
    Marcus saved two years buying. Tonight's game - potential last together if consequences
    come.
    
    "Tommy doesn't know. Thinks I'm fine. His scholarship, his future - can't burden
    him. But also...can't rob him this experience. Selfish maybe. But basketball -
    only thing left we have."
    
    Asks advice: What do? You realize - no good options. Attend game, maybe Marcus
    dies после. Sell tickets, Tommy heartbroken, debt lingers. Bet outcome, insane
    gamble. Fourth option maybe - confront Vinnie, negotiate, alternative solutions.
    
    6:30 PM - decision needed. Tommy expecting picked up 7 PM for game.

  act_one: |
    **Path A: Attend game together**
    
    Marcus decides: "Fuck it. One last moment with my son. Whatever comes после -
    comes. But tonight, we watch Heat together. Like always."
    
    Pick up Tommy: Excited, pumped, wearing Heat jersey (Jimmy Butler #22). "Dad!
    Tonight's it! Championship or bust!" Marcus faking smile, heart breaking. You
    join (Marcus gave third ticket friend originally).
    
    Arena electric: 20,000 fans, energy insane. Courtside seats incredible - smell
    sweat, hear trash talk, feel intensity. Tommy awestruck: "Dad, this...thank you.
    Best night ever." Marcus tears up, tries hide.
    
    Game intense: Back-forth, lead changes, defensive battle. Heat down 2 points,
    1 minute left. Butler drives, fadeaway...misses. Celtics ball. Tommy tense, Marcus
    clutching armrest white-knuckled.
    
    30 seconds: Heat foul, stop clock. Celtics miss free throw. Rebound Butler. 15
    seconds, Heat timeout. Coach draws play. Out timeout - Butler passes Adebayo,
    passes Herro, corner three...SWISH! Heat up 1, 8 seconds.
    
    Celtics inbound, Tatum drives, layup attempt...BLOCKED Butler! Buzzer! HEAT WIN!
    Arena erupts! Tommy/Marcus embrace, crying, screaming. "WE DID IT! CHAMPIONSHIP
    BOUND!"
    
    Moment perfect, pure, beautiful. Father-son joy, shared dream, basketball love.
    Marcus forgets debt briefly - just present, just Tommy, just this.
    
    After game: Reality crashes. Vinnie's enforcers waiting outside. Marcus sees them.
    Tommy oblivious, celebrating. Marcus pulls you aside: "It's time. Take Tommy home.
    Don't let him follow. Tell him...I love him. Always did." Heart-wrenching.
    
    **Path B: Sell tickets, partial payment**
    
    Marcus practical: "Can't risk Tommy. Sell tickets, pay Vinnie partial, buy time.
    Maybe work out payment plan."
    
    Call Tommy: "Son...game tonight...something came up. Work emergency. Can't make
    it. Sorry." Tommy devastated: "Dad...we've waited forever. It's Game 7!" Marcus
    lying poorly: "I know. I'm sorry. Sell tickets, recoup money. Emergency." Tommy
    suspicious, hurt: "Dad...what's going on? You've been weird weeks." Marcus deflects,
    hangs up guilty.
    
    Sell tickets online: Scalper marketplace, $20K quick sale. Cash collected. Meet
    Vinnie - seedy office, poker game running. Vinnie unimpressed: "$20K? Still $65K
    short. What's this, Marcus?"
    
    Marcus pleads: "It's all I have. Please. Payment plan. I'll work double, triple.
    Just...time." Vinnie considers: "You have son. Basketball player. Talented. Hear
    NBA potential. Maybe...insurance. He doesn't pay, he suffers too. Motivation."
    
    Marcus horrified: "Don't touch my son." Vinnie smiles cold: "Then pay. $65K,
    two months. Or Tommy's scholarship...accidents happen. Knee injuries common basketball."
    
    Desperation deepens. Tommy safe temporarily, але debt larger, timeline shorter,
    threats explicit. Worst - Tommy knows something wrong, trust damaged.
    
    **Path C: Bet on game outcome**
    
    Marcus gambling addict decides gamble more: "Heat win tonight - I know it. Butler's
    hot, home court, championship energy. Bet tickets value on Heat moneyline. Win,
    debt cleared. Lose...already lost anyway."
    
    Explain: Tickets worth $20K, bet Heat moneyline (slight underdog +120), win $24K
    plus original. Total $44K, bet rest savings $41K, all-in $85K. Heat win, breaks
    even, clears debt completely.
    
    You object: "Marcus, this insanity. What if lose? Everything gone, Tommy devastated,
    debt remains." Marcus adamant: "Already decided. Fate decides tonight. Heat win,
    redemption. Lose, deserved consequences. Poetic."
    
    Place bet: Vinnie takes action personally (ironic). "Marcus, you're insane. But
    fine. Heat win, clear. Heat lose, $85K becomes $170K. Your funeral." Marcus doesn't
    flinch, resignation visible.
    
    Watch game: Bar, can't afford attend. Tommy confused, hurt, doesn't understand.
    Marcus glued screen, every possession agony. You beside him, watching spiral.
    
    Game comes down final shot (same as Path A). Butler corner three, 8 seconds...miss!
    Celtics rebound, Tatum layup, buzzer! CELTICS WIN! Marcus collapses, devastated.
    Debt doubled. Ruined completely.
    
    **Path D: Confront Vinnie, negotiate alternative**
    
    You suggest: "Talk Vinnie directly. Human approach. Maybe payment plan, alternative
    collateral, something."
    
    Meet Vinnie (you join support): Explain situation - addiction, family, Tommy's
    future. Appeal humanity: "Man to man. He's sick, needs help, son innocent. Payment
    plan? Reduced amount? Anything."
    
    Vinnie surprisingly receptive: "Marcus. Known you years. Good guy, bad luck. Addiction
    problem, I get it. But business is business. $85K real money. Can't just forgive."
    
    Negotiation: Offers payment plan - $2K monthly, 5 years. Manageable але long.
    Requires Marcus: Attend GA (Gamblers Anonymous), weekly proof. Vinnie holds Tommy's
    scholarship paperwork (insurance, creepy але nonviolent). Miss payment, consequences.
    
    Marcus accepts, relieved. Keeps tickets, attends game Tommy. Moment preserved,
    debt restructured, future possible. But - five years payments, constant pressure,
    Tommy leverage. Bittersweet compromise.

  act_two: |
    **Outcomes vary by path:**
    
    **Scenario A aftermath: Attended game, Vinnie's men waiting**
    
    Tommy sent home with you. Marcus stays, faces Vinnie. Choice: Go peacefully OR
    Run OR Fight OR Confess Tommy, ask help.
    
    Peaceful: Marcus accepts beating, hospitalized, debt "forgiven" via pain. Tommy
    visits hospital, learns truth, devastated. Relationship damaged, trust broken,
    але both alive.
    
    Run: Chase ensues, ends badly - Marcus caught, beaten worse. Or escapes, goes
    underground, abandons Tommy. Tragedy.
    
    Fight: Marcus desperation, takes swing. Enforcers overpower, serious injury. ICU,
    recovery months. Tommy drops out support family. Scholarship deferred. Consequences
    cascade.
    
    Confess: "My son's outside. He doesn't know. Please...let me tell him first. Then
    do what you must." Vinnie respects honesty, gives hour. Marcus/Tommy tearful
    confession, goodbye, Tommy held back while Marcus taken. Brutal але honest ending.
    
    **Scenario B aftermath: Sold tickets, partial payment**
    
    Tommy hurt, suspicious. Confronts Marcus: "What's going on? Why sell tickets?
    Why lying?" Marcus options: Confess addiction OR Keep lying OR Half-truth.
    
    Confession: Tommy shocked, angry, scared. "How much? Why didn't tell me?" Emotional
    scene. Tommy wants help, research treatment, stands by father. Relationship strained
    але united. Together approach Vinnie, Tommy offers work off debt (summer job
    Vinnie's businesses - gray area, але legal-ish). Vinnie accepts, moved by son's
    loyalty. Long path, але hopeful.
    
    Keep lying: Tommy doesn't believe, distance grows. Marcus isolated, pressure mounts.
    Misses payment deadline. Vinnie follows through - "accident" almost happens Tommy.
    Marcus intervenes, takes full beating. Hospital, truth revealed traumatically.
    Tommy guilt-ridden, relationship shattered.
    
    **Scenario C aftermath: Bet failed, debt doubled**
    
    Marcus destroyed. $170K impossible. Vinnie ruthless: "You had chance. Gambled
    again. Now you AND Tommy pay." Targets Tommy's scholarship - anonymous tip NCAA,
    false accusations, investigation launched. Tommy's season suspended.
    
    Marcus confesses everything Tommy, breakdown. Tommy angry, scared, confused. "Dad...why?
    WHY?" Marcus no answers, just apologies. Relationship fractured. Tommy forced
    leave school, support family, basketball dream deferred potentially forever.
    
    Darkest timeline: Marcus considers suicide, insurance money. You intervene, crisis
    hotline, intervention. Tommy learns how close lost father. Shock jolts both -
    realize money meaningless versus life. Together declare bankruptcy, negotiate
    Vinnie (legal threats), restructure debt manageable. Long road, але alive, together.
    
    **Scenario D aftermath: Payment plan negotiated**
    
    Attended game, magical night. Heat won (in this path), Tommy ecstatic. Marcus
    cherished moment, future secured via plan.
    
    Five years payments: Monthly $2K, tight але doable. GA meetings weekly, Marcus
    actually engages, recovery real. Tommy learns truth year later (Marcus decides
    honesty), initial anger fades seeing father's effort. Supports recovery.
    
    Challenges: Missed payment temptation (gamble again make up), Vinnie's patience
    tested, Tommy's NBA draft interest (pressure increases). Navigate carefully,
    family bond strengthens through adversity. Hopeful ending.

  act_three: |
    **Long-term consequences:**
    
    **Path A endings:**
    - Marcus hospitalized, recovered, relationship with Tommy repaired slowly. Addiction
      addressed finally. Both alive, wiser, scarred.
    - Marcus killed (worst outcome). Tommy devastated, guilt-ridden (feels should've
      known), blames basketball, quits scholarship. Tragedy complete.
    
    **Path B endings:**
    - Tommy works off debt summer jobs, Marcus GA meetings, slow recovery. Relationship
      strained але united. Tommy's pro career delayed но saved. Practical, hard, real.
    - Trust broken completely, Tommy estranged. Marcus isolated, downward spiral.
      Possibly fatal consequences. Dark.
    
    **Path C endings:**
    - Bankruptcy, debt restructured, Tommy/Marcus rebuild from scratch. Basketball
      dream deferred, але relationship salvaged. Humbling, грounding, growth.
    - Marcus suicide attempt, intervention, crisis. Trauma bonding, forced honesty,
      painful recovery. Survival bittersweet.
    
    **Path D ending:**
    - Five years payments completed, Marcus debt-free, addiction managed, Tommy's
      NBA draft (second round). Father-son moment draft night - Marcus sober, proud,
      redeemed. Tommy: "Dad, we made it. Together." Tears, joy, earned.

  epilogue: |
    Gambling addiction ruins lives silently. Shame, secrecy, desperation - Marcus's
    story common. Sports passion turned destructive, family bonds tested, impossible
    choices forced.
    
    Tommy's innocence - both blessing, burden. Didn't know父's struggle, couldn't
    help, guilt później. Basketball love pure, але Marcus's addiction tainted. Lessons
    learned hard way.
    
    Miami Heat Game 7 - backdrop perfect, ironic. Sports meant unite, но Marcus's
    gambling divided. Redemption possible, requires honesty, help, humility.
    
    Player's choice: Preserve moment vs survival, gambling desperation vs negotiation,
    confession vs secrecy. All impact Marcus/Tommy's future. No perfect solutions,
    real consequences, human struggles.

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Emotional, heavy quest about gambling addiction реальность. Marcus sympathetic -
    loving father, mistake spiraled, desperate circumstances. Tommy innocent collateral,
    relationship core. Vinnie not villain - businessman, dangerous але not evil. Choices
    impossible - preserve moment або survive debt, gamble desperation або negotiate,
    confess або hide. Heat Game 7 backdrop perfect - sports love turned poison via
    addiction. Endings varied - redemption possible (payment plan, GA, honesty), tragedy
    possible (death, estrangement, bankruptcy). Player can't fix addiction directly -
    only help navigate crisis. Realistic portrayal: Addiction progressive disease,
    shame powerful barrier, family impact devastating, recovery requires honesty/help.
    Tommy's innocence contrasts Marcus's guilt poignantly. Basketball bond beautiful
    despite addiction taint. No perfect solutions - least destructive path varies
    player values. Attend game emotionally satisfying але dangerous. Sell tickets
    practical але hurts Tommy. Bet outcome gambling addict behavior - desperation
    logic. Negotiate smartest але long commitment. All consequences permanent - Marcus's
    recovery, Tommy's career, relationship trust. Adult quest, handles addiction
    respectfully, shows human cost gambling epidemic, emphasizes hope through honesty/recovery.
