summary:
  brief: |
    River of grass. Ancient ecosystem. Tourist attraction. Indigenous homeland. Endangered all.

  description: |
    Everglades National Park 2025 - UNESCO World Heritage Site, ecological treasure, Florida
    icon. 1.5 million acres wetlands, sawgrass marshes, alligators, rare birds, biodiversity
    hotspot. Also: Tourist trap, airboat rides, gator shows, Instagram backdrop.

    Three perspectives collide:

    **Sarah Chen (34)** - National Park Service ranger, environmental scientist, conservationist.
    Dedicated 10 years protecting Everglades. Current crisis: Record low water levels
    (climate change, overdevelopment), invasive pythons eating native species, pollution
    runoff agriculture. Park dying slowly. Needs funding, awareness, policy changes.
    Plans viral campaign - document crisis, attract attention, force action.

    **Jimmy "Gator Jim" Cypress (52)** - Miccosukee tribe member, third-generation
    airboat tour guide, cultural educator. Family lived Everglades centuries before
    Park designation 1947. Tribe displaced, commodified, но survived. Runs authentic
    cultural tours - tribal history, traditional practices, ecosystem knowledge. Hates
    tourist circus - fake gator wrestling, disrespectful commercialization. Wants preserve
    heritage AND ecosystem, balanced approach.

    **Derek Martinez (29)** - Entrepreneur, owns "Everglades Extreme Adventures" -
    largest tour operator. High-speed airboats, gator feeding shows, Instagram-perfect
    experiences. Profitable, popular, environmentally questionable. Sees opportunity
    - expand operations, helicopter tours, luxury eco-lodges (ironic). Sarah's campaign
    threatens business - negative publicity, potential regulations. Wants suppress
    crisis messaging.

    You - freelance journalist, documentary filmmaker, neutral initially. All three
    approach you: Film their perspective, tell their story, influence narrative. Choose
    sides, или balance truth, або stay silent. Everglades future at stake.

  goal: |
    Document Everglades crisis: Support Sarah's conservation OR Honor Jimmy's indigenous
    perspective OR Help Derek's business interests OR Balance competing narratives.
    Truth, culture, commerce - choose priority.

  essence: |
    Ecology vs economy quest. Climate crisis reality, indigenous displacement, tourism
    commodification, conservation challenges. No villains - Sarah right (science),
    Jimmy right (culture), Derek right (economics). Complex environmental politics,
    competing valid interests, journalism ethics. Nuanced, educational, relevant.

story:
  background: |
    Everglades history: Millennia Miccosukee/Seminole homeland. 1800s US expansion,
    indigenous removal attempts (many resisted, stayed). Early 1900s drainage projects -
    "reclaim swamp" agriculture, development. Ecosystem devastated. 1947 National
    Park designation - conservation attempt, але indigenous displacement. Irony: Protected
    nature, removed people.

    1980s-90s restoration efforts: Recognize wetlands vital - water supply South Florida,
    hurricane protection, biodiversity. Billions spent restoration. Progress slow,
    incomplete. 2020s climate change accelerates crisis: Sea level rise, extreme weather,
    temperature changes. Ecosystem stressed beyond recovery capacity potentially.

    Tourism explosion: Everglades iconic Florida experience. Airboat tours, gator shows,
    educational programs, wildlife watching. Economic boon - jobs, revenue, awareness.
    Also damage - noise pollution, habitat disruption, commercialization disrespect.
    Indigenous communities navigate complex relationship - profit from tourism, resent
    commodification, need economic survival.

  opening: |
    Monday morning, Everglades Visitor Center. You arrive shoot nature documentary.
    Sarah approaches urgent: "You're journalist? Perfect timing. Need show world what's
    happening. Everglades dying. Nobody cares. Make them care."

    Shows data: Water levels lowest 50 years, python population exploded (thousands,
    eating everything), mercury contamination fish, rare species endangered. Climate
    models predict collapse within decades if nothing changes.

    "Corporations, agriculture, development - killing ecosystem. Need exposure, pressure,
    funding. Film documentary - crisis footage, scientific evidence, call to action.
    Go viral, force politicians act. Everglades can't wait."

    Afternoon: Jimmy finds you near airboat dock. "Ranger talk to you? Listen, she's
    right ecosystem dying. But story incomplete. My people stewarded land thousand
    years. Park Service came, kicked us out, now ask help. Where's our voice? Film
    real story - indigenous knowledge, cultural loss, forced displacement. Everglades
    isn't just nature - it's homeland."

    Evening: Derek calls, heard you're filming. Invites dinner expensive Miami restaurant.
    Smooth pitch: "Everglades thriving! Tourism employs thousands, educates millions,
    generates revenue protects Park. Sarah's alarmism hurts business, kills jobs.
    Film positive angle - families enjoying nature, economic success, conservation
    through commerce. Balance, right?"

    Three narratives, three interests. Your camera captures one story. Which one?

  act_one: |
    **Path A: Conservation priority (Sarah)**

    Spend week with Sarah: Document crisis scientifically. Film dead fish mercury
    poisoning, measure water levels, interview scientists, capture python devastation.
    Footage grim, undeniable, powerful.

    Sarah passionate: "See this? Used to be nesting ground rare birds. Now empty. Pythons
    ate everything. And this water - polluted runoff sugar farms. Killing ecosystem
    base. Politicians don't care until crisis viral. Make it viral."

    Jimmy encounters during filming: "You showing ecological damage. Good. But why
    no mention whose land this? Who knows ecosystem best? Rangers study decades. My
    family lived here millennia. Respect that."

    Derek's PR team approaches: "Your documentary hurting business already. Cancellations
    mounting. Employees losing jobs. You destroying livelihoods crisis publicity. Responsible
    journalism balances perspectives. Add positive stories."

    Dilemma: Pure conservation message powerful ale incomplete. Jimmy's point valid -
    indigenous erasure. Derek's concern legitimate - economic impact real. Broaden
    focus or stay laser-focused crisis?

    **Path B: Indigenous perspective (Jimmy)**

    Embed with Miccosukee community: Jimmy introduces elders, cultural historians,
    traditional ecological knowledge keepers. Learn Everglades indigenous names, creation
    stories, ancestral connections, forced displacement history.

    Elder Thomas speaks: "White people 'discovered' Everglades like we weren't here.
    Made Park, pushed us margins. Now ecosystem dying, suddenly want our knowledge.
    Too late? Maybe. But our story deserves told."

    Jimmy shows traditional practices: Sustainable hunting, water management techniques,
    plant medicine, seasonal migration patterns. "Ancestors balanced ecosystem naturally.
    Modern science 'discovering' what we knew always. Credit where due."

    Sarah respects approach але frustrated: "Indigenous history important. But crisis
    urgent NOW. Every day delay, more damage. Documentary must prioritize action, not
    historical grievances." Tension surfaces - conservation vs social justice priorities.

    Derek sees opportunity: "Indigenous angle? Great! Market 'authentic Everglades
    experience' - tribal partnerships, cultural tours, premium pricing. Win-win." Jimmy
    disgusted: "Commodifying culture again. Exactly problem." Complexity deepens.

    **Path C: Economic perspective (Derek)**

    Tour Derek's operation: Modern airboats, safety protocols, environmental education
    programs (legitimate), happy tourists, employed guides (many local, some indigenous).
    Economic impact visible - families supported, community funded, awareness raised.

    Derek's argument compelling: "Everglades tourism brought millions visitors, generated
    billions revenue. Funded conservation, educated public, created incentive protect.
    Pure environmentalism alienates stakeholders. Sustainable tourism partners conservation.
    Sarah's alarmism counterproductive."

    Meet employees: Single mothers, students, retirees - depending jobs. "If Derek's
    business fails, we're unemployed. Everglades needs both - protection AND economic
    use. Balance possible."

    Sarah confronts: "Derek's 'sustainable tourism' destroying what attracts tourists.
    Noise pollution disrupts wildlife, boat wakes erode marshes, crowds stress ecosystem.
    Short-term profit, long-term collapse. Documenting his 'success' enables destruction."

    Jimmy adds: "Derek profits off our culture, gives nothing back. Fake gator wrestling,
    plastic headdresses sold gift shop, tribal history whitewashed. Extractive, not
    partnership." Derek defensive, але some truth stings.

    **Path D: Balanced journalism (attempt all perspectives)**

    Ambitious approach: Document ecological crisis (Sarah), indigenous history (Jimmy),
    economic realities (Derek). Comprehensive, fair, complex. Challenging - contradictions
    surface, no easy solutions, audience prefers simple narratives.

    Film all three: Sarah's science, Jimmy's culture, Derek's economics. Edit into
    multi-layered story - Everglades dying (true), indigenous displaced (true), tourism
    vital (true). Complexity uncomfortable, но honest.

  act_two: |
    **Documentary release outcomes:**

    **Scenario A: Conservation focus**

    Documentary released: Viral immediately. Hashtag #SaveEverglades trends. Celebrities
    repost. Millions views. Sarah ecstatic: "Working! Pressure mounting!"

    Government response: Senator announces Everglades restoration funding increase
    $500M. EPA investigates agricultural pollution. Python removal program expanded.
    Victory!

    Unintended consequences: Tourism plummets. Negative publicity scares visitors.
    Derek's business cuts 40% staff. Guides unemployed. Local economy hurt. Jimmy's
    cultural tours cancelled - no tourists.

    Derek bitter: "You killed industry. Congratulations. Everglades 'saved' ale nobody
    visits, nobody cares long-term, funding dries up next election cycle. Short-sighted."

    Jimmy conflicted: "Ecosystem attention good. But my voice erased again. White
    environmentalist hero story. Indigenous people invisible. Same colonialism, green
    packaging."

    **Scenario B: Indigenous focus**

    Documentary released: Critical acclaim, film festivals, cultural impact. Jimmy's
    story resonates - indigenous displacement, ecological knowledge, cultural survival.
    Awards, recognition.

    Policy impact: Federal government grants Miccosukee tribe increased land management
    role. Co-management agreement Park Service/Tribe. Funding traditional ecological
    practices integration. Historic victory.

    Ecological crisis continues: Film beautiful, important, але didn't address immediate
    environmental collapse. Sarah frustrated: "Great, indigenous justice. But pythons
    still eating ecosystem, water levels still dropping, crisis accelerating. Film
    missed urgency."

    Commercial response: Derek exploits indigenous angle aggressively - "authentic
    tribal experience" marketing, tribal imagery appropriated, Jimmy's community commodified
    further. Unintended commercialization.

    **Scenario C: Economic focus**

    Documentary released: Tourism industry loves it. Everglades marketing board promotes
    heavily. Visitor numbers surge. Derek's business expands. Economic boom.

    Sarah horrified: "You greenwashed destruction. Made exploitation look sustainable.
    Ecosystem collapsing faster now - more boats, more crowds, more damage. You're
    complicit."

    Jimmy disgusted: "Sold us out. Derek profits, community gets nothing, culture commercialized
    further. You helped colonization."

    Reality check: Increased tourism revenue DOES fund conservation (partially). More
    visitors = more awareness (sometimes). Economics complex - Derek's argument partially
    valid, але environmental cost real. Moral ambiguity uncomfortable.

    **Scenario D: Balanced approach**

    Documentary released: Complex, nuanced, challenging. Critics praise depth, general
    public confused - "What's the message? Who's right? What do I do?"

    Impact mixed: No viral moment (too complex), але serious policy discussions initiated.
    Senate hearing cites documentary. Everglades Task Force formed - conservationists,
    tribal leaders, business representatives, scientists. Comprehensive approach.

    Sarah partially satisfied: "Not viral, але substantive. Government taking seriously.
    Progress slow, але real."

    Jimmy appreciates inclusion: "First time my people's voice equal platform. Respect
    shown. Doesn't solve everything, але dignified representation matters."

    Derek accepts: "Fair portrayal. Acknowledged economic realities without excusing
    damage. Can work with this. Sustainable tourism improvements needed, I'll adapt."

    Long-term results uncertain: Complex problems resist simple solutions. Everglades
    future still threatened, але conversation elevated, stakeholders engaged, hope
    possible.

  act_three: |
    **Five years later (2030):**

    **Path A outcome:** Restoration funding delivered substantial improvements. Water
    levels stabilized, python control effective, pollution reduced. Ecosystem recovering
    slowly. Tourism rebounded - "Everglades Restored" marketing. Sarah vindicated,
    Jimmy's community still marginalized economically, Derek rebuilt business adapted
    regulations. Environmentally better, culturally incomplete, economically recovered.

    **Path B outcome:** Indigenous co-management implemented successfully. Traditional
    ecological knowledge integrated scientific management. Cultural preservation achieved.
    Ecosystem improvements modest (indigenous methods sustainable, але can't reverse
    industrial damage alone). Tourism niche - cultural focus. Sarah's crisis continues
    (slower), Derek's business smaller ale authentic partnerships. Culturally just,
    ecologically insufficient, economically reduced.

    **Path C outcome:** Tourism industry thriving, economic boom. Conservation funding
    increased (tourism revenue). Ecosystem decline slowed (money buys protection), но
    fundamental issues unaddressed. Visitor numbers unsustainable long-term. Indigenous
    community exploited commercially, cultural appropriation widespread. Economically
    successful, environmentally fragile, culturally exploitative.

    **Path D outcome:** Comprehensive approach yielded mixed results. Everglades Task
    Force implemented gradual reforms - increased conservation funding, indigenous
    land rights expansion, sustainable tourism standards. Progress incremental, conflicts
    ongoing, но all voices heard. Ecosystem stabilized (not fully recovered), indigenous
    dignity restored (partially), economic interests balanced (imperfectly). Messy,
    realistic, hopeful cautiously.

  epilogue: |
    Environmental crises rarely have villains - only competing interests, limited
    resources, difficult tradeoffs. Sarah's conservation urgency valid. Jimmy's indigenous
    justice valid. Derek's economic realities valid. All true simultaneously.

    Everglades microcosm: Climate change, indigenous rights, sustainable development -
    global challenges reflected locally. Solutions require nuance, compromise, long-term
    thinking, humility. Simple narratives satisfying, complex realities messy.

    Journalism power/responsibility: Your documentary shaped perceptions, influenced
    policy, affected livelihoods. Choices mattered. Truth multifaceted - emphasized
    aspects amplified, omitted aspects erased. Objectivity impossible, fairness achievable.

    Player's choice: Prioritize ecology, culture, economy, または balance. All consequences.
    Perfect solution elusive. Best solution debatable. Important solution attempt.

    Environmental quest without villain - Sarah, Jimmy, Derek all valid perspectives,
    competing interests. Reflects real Everglades challenges: climate crisis accelerating,
    indigenous displacement historical (ongoing), tourism both resource/threat. Player
    journalist - documentary shapes narrative, influences policy, affects people. No
    perfect choice - conservation focus damages economy/erases indigenous voice, indigenous
    focus achieves justice але ecological crisis continues, economic focus greenwashes
    exploitation, balanced approach yields incremental messy progress. Educational -
    teaches Everglades ecology, Miccosukee history, sustainable tourism complexity,
    environmental politics reality. Relevant - climate crisis, indigenous rights,

    green capitalism tensions global issues. Nuanced - avoids simplistic "nature good,
    humans bad" or "economy vs environment" binary. Shows intersection social/environmental
    justice. Journalism ethics explored - objectivity impossible, fairness achievable,
    choices consequential. Long-term outcomes (5 years later) show tradeoffs each
    path. Balanced approach most complex, least dramatic, most realistic. Quest doesn't
    solve Everglades crisis (impossible), shows complexity navigating it (valuable).
