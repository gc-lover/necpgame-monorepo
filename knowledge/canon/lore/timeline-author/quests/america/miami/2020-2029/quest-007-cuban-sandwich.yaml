summary:
  brief: |
    Perfect sandwich. Simple ingredients. Impossible standards. Cuban soul on Cuban bread.
  
  description: |
    Little Havana 2026. Calle Ocho, heart Cuban Miami. Cafecitos, domino tables, cigar
    shops, vibrant murals. Among dozens Cuban restaurants, three legendary: El Pub,
    La Carreta, Versailles. Tourists frequent. Locals argue passionately which authentic.
    
    Rosa Gutierrez (68) - owns "Rosa's Cocina," tiny hole-in-wall 40 years. No tourists,
    only locals. Her Cuban sandwich (called "Cubano" Miami) legendary among those
    who know. Secret recipe, her abuela's, brought from Havana 1962. Traditional: Cuban
    bread (soft inside, crispy crust), slow-roasted pork (mojo marinade), ham, Swiss
    cheese, pickles, mustard, pressed hot. Perfection simple.
    
    Problem: Rosa retiring. No children continue business. Wants pass recipe worthy
    successor, but high standards - must understand Cuban culture, respect tradition,
    make sandwich with soul not just technique. Announces competition - open call,
    one week, best Cubano wins recipe, restaurant, legacy. Miami's Cuban community
    excited, nervous, invested.
    
    Three finalists emerge:
    
    **Marco (32)** - Rosa's nephew, worked kitchen years, knows recipe mostly. Family
    entitlement felt, але passion genuine. Represents continuity, blood connection.
    
    **Isabela (27)** - Young chef, trained culinary school Cordon Bleu, returned Cuba
    recently research traditional cooking. Technical excellence, но lacks Rosa's "sazón"
    (that indefinable flavor soul). Represents modern interpretation, educated approach.
    
    **Tommy (45)** - Third-generation Cuban-American, doesn't speak Spanish fluently,
    grew up eating Rosa's, love deep. Works construction, cooks home hobby. Represents
    diaspora identity, cultural preservation through food.
    
    Rosa asks you - food critic, trusted friend, neutral judge - help decide. Taste
    all three, understand their stories, choose worthy heir. Simple quest, deep meaning.

  goal: |
    Help Rosa: Judge competition fairly, choose successor based on food quality OR
    cultural connection OR passion, или combination. Cuban sandwich's soul at stake.

  essence: |

story:
  background: |
    Cuban sandwich history: Debated origin - Tampa or Havana. Miami version evolved
    Cuban exile community 1960s. Became comfort food, cultural anchor, identity marker.
    Similar ingredients, но each family recipe variations - pickle thickness, pork
    marinade, bread source, pressing technique. Passion fierce - arguments endless
    which "authentic." All authentic differently.
    
    Rosa's story: Born Havana 1958. Family fled Castro regime 1962, Rosa 4 years old.
    Brought nothing але abuela's recipes memorized. Settled Little Havana, father
    worked construction, mother cleaned hotels. Rosa learned cook abuela - traditional
    techniques, ingredient respect, "cocinar con amor" (cook with love). 1986 opened
    Rosa's Cocina, tiny space, huge heart. 40 years feeding community - celebrations,
    funerals, daily meals. Unpretentious, authentic, beloved.
    
    Retirement decision: Arthritis, energy declining, time pass torch. No children
    (never married, dedicated life restaurant). Marco nephew closest family, але Rosa
    unsure he understands weight tradition carries. Competition open allows community
    voice, merit-based selection, public closure ritual. Rosa's way honor Cuban values -
    family, community, excellence.

  opening: |
    Monday morning, Rosa's Cocina. Rosa greets warmly: "Mi amor, gracias coming. Need
    your help. Retiring, passing restaurant, but who? Can't just give away. Abuela's
    legacy. Needs right person."
    
    Explains competition: Friday final judging. Three finalists. Each prepares Cubano
    their interpretation, tells story, makes case. You taste, evaluate, advise. Rosa
    decides ultimately, але respects your opinion deeply.
    
    "Not just taste. Anyone can learn recipe. Need someone understands WHY we make
    it. What sandwich means. Identity, memory, home we lost. Big responsibility."
    
    Introduces finalists:
    
    **Marco:** "Tía Rosa, I'm family. Worked here 10 years. Know recipe heart. This
    place MY future, MY inheritance. Choose me." Confident, slightly entitled, але
    genuinely loves Rosa.
    
    **Isabela:** "Sra. Gutierrez, I studied Cuba, France, everywhere. Can elevate
    Cubano traditional base, modern techniques, maintain authenticity. Respect, innovation."
    Polished, ambitious, sincere respect tradition.
    
    **Tommy:** "Ms. Rosa, I...my Spanish bad, sorry. But your sandwich - my childhood.
    Every Sunday, my dad brought me. He passed 2019. Cancer. Last meal together, your
    Cubano. I need...honor him. Learn make it right. Por favor." Emotional, humble,
    deeply connected.
    
    Rosa touched all three. To you: "See? Impossible choice. Help me understand who
    truly carries spirit."

  act_one: |
    **Week before competition: Get to know finalists**
    
    **Marco's story:**
    
    Visit Marco's apartment: Photos Rosa's Cocina walls, family gatherings, Rosa's
    younger years. Marco grew up restaurant - did homework back booth, washed dishes
    teenager, learned cook twenties. Knows regulars by name, remembers their orders,
    part community fabric.
    
    Marco cooks practice Cubano: Technically solid, familiar flavors, comfortable.
    Missing something - slightly mechanical, lacks spontaneous joy. Notices yourself,
    defensive: "What? It's good! Exactly Rosa's recipe!"
    
    Talks about plans: "Keep everything same. Rosa's Cocina stays Rosa's. No changes.
    Preserve her exactly. That's respect." Noble intention, але static. Growth/evolution
    valid too?
    
    **Isabela's story:**
    
    Meet Isabela's test kitchen (rented space): Professional setup, notebooks filled
    research, ingredients sourced meticulously. Explains traveled Cuba 2024, interviewed
    home cooks, documented regional variations, studied historical texts.
    
    Isabela's practice Cubano: Technically perfect. Bread ideal texture, pork tender,
    balance impeccable. Но...too precise? Lacks homestyle imperfection charm. Tastes
    restaurant-perfect, not abuela-made.
    
    Plans: "Expand menu slightly - traditional Cuban dishes Rosa never had space/time.
    Ropa vieja, picadillo, yuca. Make destination, not just sandwich spot. Honor tradition,
    share broader." Ambitious, thoughtful, риск losing focus simplicity made Rosa's special.
    
    **Tommy's story:**
    
    Visit Tommy home: Small, working-class, kitchen clearly used lovingly. Photos
    with father everywhere - young Tommy eating Rosa's, father smiling. Bittersweet
    nostalgia tangible.
    
    Tommy cooks practice: Nervous, makes mistakes (bread slightly burnt edge), але
    something magical happens - pours heart into it. Tastes imperfect, но soulful.
    Flavors warm, comforting, made with visible love.
    
    Explains: "Dad came Cuba 1980, Mariel boatlift. Worked three jobs, raised me alone.
    Mom left early. Rosa's - our place. Sundays, tradition. Dad told Cuba stories,
    I ate sandwich, felt connected roots I never knew. Food memory powerful. Want
    give others that."
    
    Plans: "Honestly? Keep exactly Rosa's. Change nothing. If people come, great.
    If not, least I preserved something precious. Not about business - about memory."
    Humble, simple, pure motivation.

  act_two: |
    **Friday - Competition day**
    
    Rosa's Cocina packed: Community members, regulars, curious onlookers. Rosa presides,
    you at judges table (Rosa, you, two community elders).
    
    **Round 1: The Sandwich**
    
    Each prepares Cubano, blind tasting (labeled A, B, C).
    
    **Sandwich A (Marco):** Competent, familiar, safe. Tastes exactly Rosa's -
    accurate reproduction. Reliable, если predictable. Elders nod approval: "Just
    like always. Good."
    
    **Sandwich B (Isabela):** Exceptional technique. Perfect ratios, ideal temperature,
    textbook. Delicious, impressive, але...sterile? Missing warmth. You note: "Beautiful,
    но feels restaurant fancy, not home comfort."
    
    **Sandwich C (Tommy):** Imperfect - cheese slightly overmelt one side, pickle
    placement uneven. But flavors sing - pork incredibly flavorful, bread just right
    crisp/soft, assembled with care visible every bite. Tastes like love. Rosa tears
    up tasting: "Ay dios...this...this tastes like my abuela's." Emotional weight clear.
    
    **Round 2: The Story**
    
    Each explains why deserves inherit.
    
    **Marco:** "Family. Blood. I'm Rosa's nephew. Worked here decade. Know every
    regular, every recipe, every story. This restaurant MY history too. Who better
    continue family legacy than family? Tía, I'll make you proud. Promise." Strong
    argument - continuity, familiarity, proven dedication.
    
    **Isabela:** "Respect tradition doesn't mean freeze time. Cuban food evolved centuries -
    Spanish, African, Caribbean influences. Honoring Rosa means carrying forward, not
    just preserving. I studied, researched, respect deeply. Can elevate while maintaining
    soul. Rosa's deserves thrive, not just survive." Compelling - growth valid, excellence
    matters, studied dedication impressive.
    
    **Tommy:** "I...barely speak Spanish. Never been Cuba. Third generation, losing
    connection. But food - food remembers. Every bite Rosa's Cubano, I'm with my dad.
    I'm Cuba, even never stepped foot there. Want give that others. Preserve, honor,
    remember. Not for profit. For love." Raw, emotional, honest. Rosa crying now.
    
    **Community input:**
    
    Regulars speak: Prefer Marco (familiar), respect Isabela (talented), love Tommy
    (heart). Divided opinions. Rosa looks you: "What you think? Who carries spirit?"

  act_three: |
    **Decision paths:**
    
    **Choose Marco:**
    
    Rosa announces: "Marco, mi sobrino. You're family. You understand. Restaurant
    yours."
    
    Marco emotional, hugs Rosa. Community applauds, но some disappointed - safe choice.
    Isabela gracious, Tommy quietly devastated.
    
    **One year later:** Rosa's Cocina unchanged. Solid, reliable, community staple.
    Marco preserves faithfully, no innovation. Business stable, не growing. Tommy
    stopped visiting - too painful. Rosa satisfied, slightly wondering "what if."
    
    **Choose Isabela:**
    
    Rosa announces: "Isabela, your dedication, skill, respect traditions - I see future
    in you."
    
    Isabela shocked, grateful. Community mixed - some excited, some skeptical. Marco
    bitter, Tommy accepts peacefully.
    
    **One year later:** Rosa's Cocina expanded menu, Yelp popular, tourists discover,
    lines forming. Quality exceptional, atmosphere slightly changed - more polished,
    less homey. Original regulars some alienated, new crowd appreciates. Financial
    success, cultural transformation. Rosa conflicted - proud, also nostalgic simplicity.
    
    **Choose Tommy:**
    
    Rosa announces: "Tommy. You don't speak Spanish perfect, you not Cuban-born, you
    not trained chef. But you understand most important - sandwich is love. It's yours."
    
    Tommy speechless, crying. Community erupts - cheers, some tears. Marco disappointed
    але respects, Isabela gracious. Rosa beaming.
    
    **One year later:** Rosa's Cocina exactly same. Tommy kept everything - menu, decor,
    recipes, spirit. Added one thing - photos wall, customers with fathers, celebrating
    memory through food. Business modest, community intimate, soul intact. Rosa visits
    weekly, proud beyond words. Tommy teaches son make Cubano - fourth generation,
    tradition continues.
    
    **Choose shared leadership (compromise):**
    
    Rosa creative: "Why choose? Marco runs business, Isabela develops menu specials,
    Tommy preserves original Cubano recipe. All three contribute. Family, skill, heart -
    together."
    
    Complicated, але interesting. Requires collaboration.
    
    **One year later:** Mixed results. Marco/Isabela clash sometimes (tradition vs
    innovation), Tommy mediates (heart). Menu expanded thoughtfully, original Cubano
    unchanged shrine. Broader appeal, maintained soul. Messier, але alive. Rosa amused -
    just like Cuban family, loud, passionate, loving.

  epilogue: |
    Food cultural memory. Cuban sandwich - simple ingredients, complex meaning. Exile
    identity, homeland lost, community built, tradition preserved through taste. Rosa's
    competition wasn't about food - about who understands responsibility carrying culture.
    
    Marco represented blood continuity - valid, comfortable, safe. Isabela represented
    excellence evolution - valid, ambitious, risky. Tommy represented diaspora connection -
    valid, emotional, pure. No wrong choice, different priorities.
    
    Player's decision: Value family ties, technical skill, emotional connection, или
    balance. All legitimate. Cuban community argues passionately these questions always -
    what authentic? Who Cuban enough? How preserve without freeze?
    
    Answer: All ways valid. Marco's preservation important. Isabela's evolution important.
    Tommy's heart important. Rosa's wisdom asking community participate decision -
    very Cuban. Respects collective voice, personal judgment, tradition negotiation.
    
    Perfect Medianoche isn't about ingredients getting right. It's about love, memory,
    connection cooking into every bite. That's sazón. That's what Rosa taught. That's
    what winner understood.

    Wholesome cultural quest. No combat, no villains, just people caring deeply about
    sandwich representing identity, memory, home. Light surface, meaningful depth.

    third generation (Tommy), outside observer (Isabela). Each perspective valid.
    Debates Cuban authenticity ongoing community - who Cuban enough? What authentic?
    Quest doesn't answer definitively - shows complexity, respects different approaches.
    Marco's preservation valuable. Isabela's evolution legitimate. Tommy's heart pure.
