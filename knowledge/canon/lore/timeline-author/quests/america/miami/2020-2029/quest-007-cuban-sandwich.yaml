summary:
  brief: |
    Perfect sandwich. Simple ingredients. Impossible standards. Cuban soul on Cuban bread.
  
  description: |
    Little Havana 2026. Calle Ocho, heart Cuban Miami. Cafecitos, domino tables, cigar
    shops, vibrant murals. Among dozens Cuban restaurants, three legendary: El Pub,
    La Carreta, Versailles. Tourists frequent. Locals argue passionately which authentic.
    
    Rosa Gutierrez (68) - owns "Rosa's Cocina," tiny hole-in-wall 40 years. No tourists,
    only locals. Her Cuban sandwich (called "Cubano" Miami) legendary among those
    who know. Secret recipe, her abuela's, brought from Havana 1962. Traditional: Cuban
    bread (soft inside, crispy crust), slow-roasted pork (mojo marinade), ham, Swiss
    cheese, pickles, mustard, pressed hot. Perfection simple.
    
    Problem: Rosa retiring. No children continue business. Wants pass recipe worthy
    successor, but high standards - must understand Cuban culture, respect tradition,
    make sandwich with soul not just technique. Announces competition - open call,
    one week, best Cubano wins recipe, restaurant, legacy. Miami's Cuban community
    excited, nervous, invested.
    
    Three finalists emerge:
    
    **Marco (32)** - Rosa's nephew, worked kitchen years, knows recipe mostly. Family
    entitlement felt, але passion genuine. Represents continuity, blood connection.
    
    **Isabela (27)** - Young chef, trained culinary school Cordon Bleu, returned Cuba
    recently research traditional cooking. Technical excellence, но lacks Rosa's "sazón"
    (that indefinable flavor soul). Represents modern interpretation, educated approach.
    
    **Tommy (45)** - Third-generation Cuban-American, doesn't speak Spanish fluently,
    grew up eating Rosa's, love deep. Works construction, cooks home hobby. Represents
    diaspora identity, cultural preservation through food.
    
    Rosa asks you - food critic, trusted friend, neutral judge - help decide. Taste
    all three, understand their stories, choose worthy heir. Simple quest, deep meaning.

  goal: |
    Help Rosa: Judge competition fairly, choose successor based on food quality OR
    cultural connection OR passion, или combination. Cuban sandwich's soul at stake.

  essence: |
    Cultural preservation quest. Food as identity, tradition transmission, diaspora
    connection. Light-hearted surface, meaningful depth. No combat, no villains, just
    people caring deeply about sandwich. Wholesome, heartfelt, delicious.

    Wholesome cultural quest. No combat, no villains, just people caring deeply about
    sandwich representing identity, memory, home. Light surface, meaningful depth.
    Food as cultural preservation mechanism explored thoughtfully. Cuban exile community
    dynamics shown respectfully - first generation (Rosa), second generation (Marco),
    third generation (Tommy), outside observer (Isabela). Each perspective valid.
    Debates Cuban authenticity ongoing community - who Cuban enough? What authentic?
    Quest doesn't answer definitively - shows complexity, respects different approaches.
    Marco's preservation valuable. Isabela's evolution legitimate. Tommy's heart pure.
    Shared leadership messy, realistic. No perfect choice - priorities differ. Player
