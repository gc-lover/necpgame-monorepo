summary:
  brief: |
    Speedboat. Open water. Three hundred horsepower. One second changes everything.
  
  description: |
    Miami 2027. Biscayne Bay - turquoise waters, downtown skyline backdrop, wealthy
    yachts leisure. Also: Underground speedboat racing scene. High-stakes, illegal,
    dangerous. Cigarette boats, offshore racers, modified engines, 100+ mph water.
    Adrenaline junkies, gambling crowds, criminal money laundering. Miami Vice reality.
    
    **Victor "Vic" Santos (38)** - Former offshore racing champion, 5-time winner
    Miami-Nassau Cup (legitimate). 2023 accident: Friend/co-pilot Carlos died, Vic
    injured, career ended. Guilt consumed him. Turned drugs/alcohol, marriage collapsed,
    sponsorships gone. 2027 hitting bottom - broke, divorced, PTSD nightmares, suicidal
    ideation forming.
    
    Underground promoter "Snake" Rodriguez approaches: "Vic, you're washed up. But
    name still carries weight. Race for me - one event, big payout. Win, earn $50K.
    Lose, still $10K showing up. Easy money." Vic desperate, agrees.
    
    Realizes too late: Snake's races dirty - sabotage common, violence expected, competitors
    ruthless. Drug cartel money laundering through betting. Coast Guard hunting races,
    arrests likely. Vic trapped - needs money, але integrity clashing, dangerous exit
    implications.
    
    Three paths emerge:
    
    **Path 1: Race clean, win legitimately** - Prove skill still intact, reject corruption,
    risk Snake's wrath. Redemption through excellence.
    
    **Path 2: Play dirty, survive chaos** - Sabotage competitors, use street tactics,
    embrace underground. Pragmatism over principles.
    
    **Path 3: Expose operation, cooperate authorities** - Contact Coast Guard/DEA,
    bust Snake's operation, testify. Whistleblower consequences.
    
    You - freelance journalist, investigating underground racing scene. Meet Vic pre-race,
    sense broken man seeking purpose. Can help redemption, enable corruption, або
    expose system. Vic's second chance, maybe last chance, in your hands partly.

  goal: |
    Help Vic navigate race: Support clean redemption OR Enable survival-at-costs OR
    Expose illegal operation. Adrenaline, morality, consequences collide.

  essence: |
    Redemption arc quest. PTSD, guilt, rock bottom, second chance. Miami's glamour
    hiding darkness - underground crime, addiction struggles, desperate choices. Fast-paced,
    morally complex, emotionally grounded. Racing exciting, human story compelling.

    single moment, daily struggle, therapy needed, relapses possible. Racing exciting
    механика, human story compelling core. Multiple valid paths: Clean racing proves
    skill remained, dirty tactics survival pragmatism, whistleblowing moral courage,

    Miami Vice aesthetic - speedboats, crime, glamour, danger. Carlos's death central -
    survivor guilt driving force, healthy grieving honors deceased living well not
    dying guilt. Player co-pilot literally/figuratively - your choices influence Vic's
    path significantly. Sometimes best help holding space grief not solving problems.
