summary:
  brief: |
    Speedboat. Open water. Three hundred horsepower. One second changes everything.
  
  description: |
    Miami 2027. Biscayne Bay - turquoise waters, downtown skyline backdrop, wealthy
    yachts leisure. Also: Underground speedboat racing scene. High-stakes, illegal,
    dangerous. Cigarette boats, offshore racers, modified engines, 100+ mph water.
    Adrenaline junkies, gambling crowds, criminal money laundering. Miami Vice reality.
    
    **Victor "Vic" Santos (38)** - Former offshore racing champion, 5-time winner
    Miami-Nassau Cup (legitimate). 2023 accident: Friend/co-pilot Carlos died, Vic
    injured, career ended. Guilt consumed him. Turned drugs/alcohol, marriage collapsed,
    sponsorships gone. 2027 hitting bottom - broke, divorced, PTSD nightmares, suicidal
    ideation forming.
    
    Underground promoter "Snake" Rodriguez approaches: "Vic, you're washed up. But
    name still carries weight. Race for me - one event, big payout. Win, earn $50K.
    Lose, still $10K showing up. Easy money." Vic desperate, agrees.
    
    Realizes too late: Snake's races dirty - sabotage common, violence expected, competitors
    ruthless. Drug cartel money laundering through betting. Coast Guard hunting races,
    arrests likely. Vic trapped - needs money, але integrity clashing, dangerous exit
    implications.
    
    Three paths emerge:
    
    **Path 1: Race clean, win legitimately** - Prove skill still intact, reject corruption,
    risk Snake's wrath. Redemption through excellence.
    
    **Path 2: Play dirty, survive chaos** - Sabotage competitors, use street tactics,
    embrace underground. Pragmatism over principles.
    
    **Path 3: Expose operation, cooperate authorities** - Contact Coast Guard/DEA,
    bust Snake's operation, testify. Whistleblower consequences.
    
    You - freelance journalist, investigating underground racing scene. Meet Vic pre-race,
    sense broken man seeking purpose. Can help redemption, enable corruption, або
    expose system. Vic's second chance, maybe last chance, in your hands partly.

  goal: |
    Help Vic navigate race: Support clean redemption OR Enable survival-at-costs OR
    Expose illegal operation. Adrenaline, morality, consequences collide.

  essence: |
    Redemption arc quest. PTSD, guilt, rock bottom, second chance. Miami's glamour
    hiding darkness - underground crime, addiction struggles, desperate choices. Fast-paced,
    morally complex, emotionally grounded. Racing exciting, human story compelling.

story:
  background: |
    Miami offshore racing history: Legitimate sport decades - Miami-Nassau Cup, Key
    West Championships, Superboat International. High-speed powerboats, skilled pilots,
    corporate sponsors, celebrity participants. Don Johnson, Sonny Crockett vibes
    real life.
    
    Underground scene evolved parallel: No regulations, unlimited modifications, higher
    speeds, criminal funding. Betting enormous - millions wagered single race. Cartel
    money laundered clean through betting networks. Coast Guard/DEA aware, difficultly
    catching - races announced last minute, scattered locations, fast boats outrun
    patrol vessels.
    
    Vic's story: Born Key West, boat family, natural talent. Started racing teens,
    turned pro 24, dominated 2015-2022. Five Miami-Nassau victories (record). Married
    Elena 2018, daughter Sofia born 2020. Life perfect. Carlos Mendez best friend/co-pilot -
    navigator critical high-speed racing, brotherly bond.
    
    2023 accident: Miami-Nassau race, mechanical failure, boat flipped 95 mph. Vic
    ejected, survived (broken ribs, concussion). Carlos trapped, drowned before rescue.
    Vic haunted - should've checked engine personally, didn't, Carlos died his negligence
    (irrational guilt). PTSD developed, survivor's guilt consumed, self-medicated
    alcohol/pills. Elena tried support, exhausted, divorced 2025. Sofia custody lost.
    Rock bottom 2027.

  opening: |
    Thursday evening, dive bar South Beach. You interview Vic - article underground
    racing. Vic drunk, bitter, broken: "Used to be somebody. Champion. Now? Nothing.
    Race Sunday. Probably die. Don't care."
    
    You probe gently: Story emerges - Carlos, accident, guilt, spiral. Vic shows scars
    (physical emotional): "Every night, I see him. Water filling cockpit. Screaming
    my name. I couldn't...couldn't save him. Should've been me died."
    
    Explains Snake's offer: "Illegal, yeah. Dangerous, yeah. But what else I got?
    Fifty grand - maybe see Sofia again. Pay child support owed. Something."
    
    You sense story bigger than racing - redemption possibility, human tragedy, moral
    complexity. Offer help: "Let me crew with you. Document race, but also...help
    you through this. You don't deserve die Biscayne Bay."
    
    Vic suspicious: "Why care? You journalist. Just want story." But desperation/loneliness
    wins: "Fine. Race Sunday dawn. Fisher Island start. Bring camera. Bring prayers."

  act_one: |
    **Friday - Preparation**
    
    Meet Vic's boat: 42-foot Cigarette Racing Team, custom V-hull, twin Mercury Racing
    1350 engines (2700 HP total). Named "Blue Thunder" - Carlos chose name 2019.
    Vic hasn't raced since accident, boat neglected, condition questionable.
    
    Inspection reveals issues: Engine tuning off, hull stress cracks, navigation equipment
    outdated. Vic overwhelmed: "Used to have team - mechanics, sponsors. Now just
    me. Can't afford repairs. Snake said boat fine. Lying probably."
    
    **Choice emerges:**
    
    **Path A: Help repair properly** - Spend day/night fixing boat right. Costs $2K
    parts (you loan?), time intensive, але integrity maintained. Boat race-ready clean.
    
    **Path B: Quick sabotage prep** - Install hidden advantages Snake suggested - nitrous
    boost (illegal), oil slick dispenser (dirty), GPS jammer (cheating). Win chances
    higher, morality compromised.
    
    **Path C: Contact authorities** - Call Coast Guard contact, inform race details,
    wear wire. Evidence gathering mode. Risk enormous if discovered.
    
    **Saturday - Meet competitors**
    
    Snake's warehouse, pre-race briefing: 8 boats entered, $400K prize pool ($50K
    winner, rest betting). Competitors introduced:
    
    **"Razor" Martinez** - Cuban cartel racer, ruthless, known sabotage tactics. Boat
    heavily armored, weapons rumored onboard. Villain obvious.
    
    **Jessica "Jess" Chen** - Former Navy pilot, thrill seeker, adrenaline junkie.
    Clean racer, incredibly skilled, respects Vic's legacy. Potential ally/rival honorable.
    
    **"Psycho" Mike Donovan** - Florida Keys crazy, meth rumors, reckless, dangerous
    everyone including himself. Wild card.
    
    Others: Cartel money, street racers converted water, rich kids slumming. Varied
    skill/morality.
    
    Snake privately threatens Vic: "You better perform. I'm betting heavily you. Don't
    embarrass me. Or else." Implied violence clear. Vic scared, angry, trapped.

  act_two: |
    **Sunday dawn - Race begins**
    
    Fisher Island offshore, sun rising, Miami skyline glowing. Eight boats idling,
    engines roaring. Course: Fisher Island → Boca Chica Key (40 miles south) → return
    Fisher Island (80 miles total). Open water, high speed, no rules.
    
    You aboard Blue Thunder co-pilot seat (Carlos's former seat - Vic emotional).
    Radio chatter, Snake's crew coordinates betting, Coast Guard patrol mentioned
    miles away.
    
    **Green flag - acceleration violent:**
    
    Eight boats launch simultaneously, waves crashing, spray blinding, sound deafening.
    100 mph instantly. Vic's skill resurfaces - muscle memory, instinct, flow state.
    For first time years, alive. "This...this I remember!" Exhilaration breaking through
    trauma momentarily.
    
    **Mile 10 - Razor's sabotage:**
    
    Razor pulls alongside, crew member throws metal chain water Vic's path. Designed
    tangle propeller, cripple boat. Vic anticipates (experience), swerves, avoids.
    Psycho Mike behind hits chain, engine explodes, boat dead water. Razor laughs,
    accelerates away.
    
    Vic furious: "This what Snake's races are. Dirty, violent, no honor." Dilemma
    surfaces - retaliate, maintain clean, report authorities?
    
    **Your influence critical here:**
    
    **Path A: Encourage clean racing** - "Vic, you're better than this. Beat them
    skill, not tactics. Prove you still champion. Honor Carlos memory right way."
    Vic's integrity reinforced, racing clean. Harder, але redemptive.
    
    **Path B: Enable retaliation** - "Vic, they're trying kill you. Survival matters.
    Use Snake's tricks. Fight fire with fire." Vic embraces dark tactics, activates
    sabotage equipment prepared. Effective, morally corrosive.
    
    **Path C: Abort, signal authorities** - "Vic, this insane. People die here. We
    got evidence. Let's end this now." Activate hidden GPS beacon, Coast Guard responds.
    Race interrupted, arrests happen. Vic's reputation complicated, але conscience
    clear.
    
    **Mile 30 - Boca Chica turn:**
    
    Lead pack: Razor, Jess, Vic. Razor's boat faster (illegal mods), Jess technically
    superior (Navy training), Vic experience/instinct edge. Tight three-way battle.
    
    Emotional moment: Passing Carlos death spot (GPS coordinates Vic memorized). Vic
    freezes briefly, boat wobbles, loses speed. Trauma triggering. "I can't...I can't
    do this. Carlos..."
    
    **Critical choice - your response:**
    
    **Comfort/ground him:** "Vic, Carlos would want you racing. Living. Forgiving
    yourself. He loved this. Honor him finishing." Vic refocuses, tears streaming,
    pushes throttle. Emotional breakthrough.
    
    **Ignore emotions, tactical focus:** "Vic, no time! Jess passing! Move!" Practical,
    effective, але emotional healing delayed. Wins race possibly, misses redemption.
    
    **Stop racing, process grief:** "Vic, pull over. Let's talk. Right now." Vic breaks
    down, cries, mourns Carlos properly finally. Race lost, healing begins. Prize
    money gone, але therapy moment invaluable.

  act_three: |
    **Final stretch - outcomes:**
    
    **Scenario A: Clean racing, emotional breakthrough**
    
    Vic races inspired - skill, heart, Carlos's spirit felt. Final mile neck-and-neck
    Jess (Razor disqualified sabotage caught, Coast Guard intercepted separately).
    Photo finish - Jess wins by 0.3 seconds. Vic second place ($20K).
    
    Post-race: Snake angry, але pays. Vic exhausted, happy, transformed: "I didn't
    win. But I raced clean. Faced demons. Carlos would've been proud. That's winning."
    Jess respects Vic, offers legitimate racing comeback sponsorship. Future hopeful.
    
    **One year later:** Vic sober, therapy regular, rebuilding Sofia relationship.
    Racing legitimate circuit again (not champion level, но respected). Clean, healthy,
    alive. Elena cautiously supportive co-parenting. Redemption achieved slowly.
    
    **Scenario B: Dirty tactics, survival mode**
    
    Vic embraces Snake's methods - sabotages Jess (oil slick, barely avoids crash),
    intimidates others, races ruthlessly. Crosses finish line first, wins $50K.
    
    Victory hollow: Snake pleased, offers regular gig. Vic accepts - money needs outweigh
    integrity. Becomes regular underground racer, skill prostituted criminal enterprise.
    Sofia sees money, not father. Guilt deepens. Racing therapy became addiction/curse.
    
    **One year later:** Vic trapped underground circuit. Wealthy, але miserable. PTSD
    worsened, nightmares intensified, Carlos's ghost angrier. Second accident coming
    inevitably. Redemption failed, descent continued. Cautionary tale.
    
    **Scenario C: Whistleblower cooperation**
    
    Mid-race Coast Guard arrives (your signal), surrounds fleet, arrests Snake's crew,
    confiscates boats, racers detained. Vic cooperates, testifies, immunity granted.
    Snake imprisoned 15 years, cartel network disrupted.
    
    Community reaction mixed: Some call Vic hero (stopped crime), others snitch (broke
    code). Underground scene blacklisted permanently. Prize money zero, але conscience
    clear, legal troubles avoided.
    
    **One year later:** Vic works Coast Guard consultant - maritime safety, racing
    regulations, youth programs. Stable income, purposeful work, Sofia proud. Carlos's
    death meaningful - preventing others'. Different redemption, quieter, valuable.
    No racing rush, але peace achieved.
    
    **Scenario D: Emotional breakdown, race abandoned**
    
    Vic pulls Blue Thunder over mid-race, floats Biscayne Bay, cries uncontrollably.
    You hold space, silent support. Hours pass, grief pours out finally. Carlos mourned
    properly, guilt acknowledged, forgiveness self begins.
    
    Snake furious, threatens. Vic stands firm: "Done. Keep money. I'm out." Coast
    Guard investigates separately (your tip), Snake arrested eventually.
    
    **One year later:** Vic never raced again. Therapy intensive, PTSD managed, sobriety
    maintained. Opened boat repair shop Key Biscayne - honest work, water connection
    maintained safely. Sofia visits weekends, relationship healing. Slower redemption,
    deeper healing. Carlos's memory honored life lived well, not racing won.

  epilogue: |
    Redemption non-linear. Vic's journey shows multiple valid paths - racing excellence,
    whistleblowing courage, emotional healing, даже failure teaching lessons. No
    single "correct" choice. Priorities differ - money, integrity, safety, healing,
    legacy.
    
    PTSD reality portrayed: Not overcome single heroic moment. Daily struggle, therapy
    needed, relapses possible, progress gradual. Vic's survivor guilt common veterans,
    first responders, accident survivors. Racing metaphor life - speed, danger, control
    illusion, consequences instant.
    
    Miami duality explored: Glamorous surface (speedboats, wealth, excitement) hiding
    darkness (crime, addiction, desperation). Tourist postcard vs lived reality. Quest
    shows both honestly.
    
    Player's role significant: Co-pilot seat literally, emotional support figuratively.
    Your choices influence Vic's path - encouragement matters, judgment harmful, presence
    healing. Sometimes best help isn't solving problems, holding space grief.
    
    Carlos's death: Never resolved, always carried. Vic learns live with grief, not
    erase it. Healthy grieving honors deceased through living well, not dying guilt.
    Racing Carlos memory clean > winning dirty. Love expressed remembering joyfully,
    not suffering endlessly.
    
    Second chances precious, complex, uncertain. Vic gets one. What he does with it -
    player's guidance, his agency, life's unpredictability. Blue Thunder rides again.
    Redemption possible. Not guaranteed.

    Redemption arc racing quest. Vic's PTSD portrayed realistically - not overcome
    single moment, daily struggle, therapy needed, relapses possible. Racing exciting
    механика, human story compelling core. Multiple valid paths: Clean racing proves
    skill remained, dirty tactics survival pragmatism, whistleblowing moral courage,
    emotional healing deepest redemption. No single correct choice - priorities differ.
    Miami Vice aesthetic - speedboats, crime, glamour, danger. Carlos's death central -
    survivor guilt driving force, healthy grieving honors deceased living well not
    dying guilt. Player co-pilot literally/figuratively - your choices influence Vic's
    path significantly. Sometimes best help holding space grief not solving problems.
    One year later endings show realistic outcomes - clean redemption slow rebuilding,
    dirty survival hollow trap, whistleblower purposeful quiet, emotional healing
    deepest peace. Quest respects that healing non-linear, redemption complex, second
    chances precious но uncertain. Racing mechanics engaging - 100 mph speeds, sabotage
    tactics, emotional triggers mid-race, Carlos death spot passing critical moment.
