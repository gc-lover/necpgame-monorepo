  brief: |
    Art Basel Miami 2028. Invisible painting worth $12M. Nobody sees emperor naked.
  
  description: |
    Art Basel Miami Beach - annual December event, world's premier modern/contemporary
    art show. Galleries worldwide, ultra-wealthy collectors, celebrities, influencers,
    $3B+ sales week. Wynwood Walls, Miami Beach Convention Center, exclusive parties,
    champagne, absurd prices. Art market peak capitalism - speculation, money laundering,
    status symbols, genuine artists struggling survive while bananas duct-taped walls
    sell millions.
    
    2028 sensation: Viktor Volkov, reclusive Russian conceptual artist (rumored dead
    2025, resurfaced mysteriously) unveils masterpiece - "Invisible Painting #47."
    Literally: Empty gilded frame, 8x10 feet, titled plaque, nothing inside. Concept:
    "Art exists viewer's mind, not canvas. Invisible painting truest art - pure idea,
    unmediated, democratically inaccessible." Pretentious? Absolutely. Genius? Debatable.
    Price? $12 million.
    
    Gallerina Svetlana Petrova (Volkov's agent) masterful marketing: "Revolutionary!
    Transcends medium! Post-visual art movement! Only enlightened collectors understand!"
    Media frenzy - CNN, New York Times, social media exploding. Half mocking, half
    intrigued, nobody admits don't "get it" (emperor's new clothes dynamics).
    
    Billionaire Marcus Chen (tech mogul, art collector, insecure ego) announces purchase -
    $12M, highest-profile buy Basel 2028. Press conference: "Volkov visionary. I see
    painting. You don't? Unfortunate." Condescending, smug, desperate prove sophistication.
    
    You - art critic/investigative journalist, smell scam. Research Volkov: Died 2025
    St. Petersburg overdose (official), але body never found, rumors faking death common
    art world (increases value). Svetlana connections suspicious - oligarch ties,
    Cayman accounts, previous fraud allegations dismissed.
    
    Three possibilities: 1) Volkov alive, genius conceptual artist, legitimate. 2)
    Svetlana running elaborate con, Volkov dead/fictional, Chen mark. 3) Chen/Svetlana
    collaborating - fake sale, money laundering scheme, publicity stunt.
    
    Investigation leads multiple directions: Expose fraud OR Appreciate legitimate
    art OR Steal "invisible painting" (absurd heist) OR Ignore, enjoy Basel chaos.
    Art world's contradictions on full display.

  goal: |
    Navigate Art Basel circus: Investigate Volkov mystery, expose fraud if exists,
    appreciate art if genuine, steal invisible painting (hilariously), или just observe
    absurdity. Truth, satire, art collide.

  essence: |
    Satirical art world quest. Social commentary: Wealth inequality, art market speculation,
    cultural gatekeeping, emperor's new clothes phenomenon. Cyberpunk capitalism meets
    conceptual art. Funny, sharp, thought-provoking. Heist optional, philosophy unavoidable.

story:
  background: |
    Art Basel history: Founded 1970 Switzerland, expanded Miami Beach 2002. Became
    premier contemporary art fair Americas. December Miami event - galleries 30+ countries,
    70,000+ visitors, $3-4B sales annually. Parallel events: Wynwood galleries, private
    collections tours, celebrity parties, ultra-exclusive dinners. Wealthy playground,
    art commodified maximum.
    
    Invisible art precedent: Yves Klein "The Void" 1958 (empty gallery), Salvatore
    Garau "Io Sono" 2021 (invisible sculpture sold $18K), conceptual art tradition
    questioning medium. Serious philosophical questions: What defines art? Artist
    intention? Viewer perception? Market value? Or just scam?
    
    Viktor Volkov backstory (conflicting accounts): Born Moscow 1965 (maybe), studied
    Surikov Institute (unverified), Soviet underground art scene 1980s (rumored),
    emigrated Berlin 1991 (documented), works exhibited MoMA 2015 (confirmed), reclusive
    lifestyle (verified), mysterious death 2025 (official, suspicious). Svetlana Petrova
    (longtime agent) only contact. Works valuable, controversial, often incomprehensible.
    Perfect conceptual artist or elaborate fiction?

  opening: |
    Thursday evening, Art Basel opening VIP preview. Wynwood Walls packed - galleries,
    champagne, beautiful people, art everywhere. You attend press credentials, planning
    critique article excess/absurdity.
    
    Svetlana's gallery booth center attention: Massive crowd, empty frame spotlighted
    dramatically, security guards flanking (protecting nothing?). Svetlana holds court:
    "Viktor Volkov returns death itself! 'Invisible Painting #47' transcends visual,
    enters conceptual pure form. $12 million asking, inquiries flooding."
    
    Observers reactions mixed: Some nodding sagely ("Brilliant!"), others confused
    whispering, few laughing quietly. Nobody admits don't understand - social pressure
    conformity, fear appearing unsophisticated. Emperor's new clothes real-time.
    
    Marcus Chen appears, entourage trailing. Public announcement: "I'm purchasing
    Invisible Painting. Volkov genius. Vision unparalleled. Proud add collection."
    Applause (performative). Chen smug, Svetlana triumphant. Transaction pending authentication
    (how authenticate invisible?).
    
    You approach Svetlana, interview request. Defensive immediately: "Journalist?
    Skeptic probably. Philistines always question genius. Volkov alive, well, painting
    real as any Picasso. Perception defines reality." Evasive, rehearsed, suspicious.
    
    Separate corner, overhear gallery assistant whisper colleague: "Volkov's dead.
    Svetlana made this up. Empty frame genius? Please. Scam obvious. But nobody admits
    cause embarrassment." Confirmation bias or insider knowledge?

  act_one: |
    **Path A: Investigate fraud theory**
    
    Research Volkov's death: 2025 St. Petersburg official report - heroin overdose,
    body found apartment, cremated quickly (family request). Але suspicious details:
    No family located, autopsy rushed, photos blurry, witnesses contradictory. Russian
    bureaucracy sloppy або deliberate cover-up?
    
    Financial investigation: Svetlana's gallery accounts labyrinthine - Cayman Islands,
    Swiss banks, shell corporations. Money flows unclear, але patterns suggest laundering.
    Previous fraud allegations 2019 - fake Rothko sold collector, dismissed lack evidence.
    Pattern emerging.
    
    Contact Interpol art crimes unit: Agent Maria Santos shares intel: "Volkov death
    suspicious. Body identification questionable. Svetlana person of interest multiple
    investigations. Invisible Painting scam possibly, але proving difficult - how verify
    something doesn't exist?"
    
    Interview Chen privately (bribes assistant access): Chen defensive: "I understand
    art. You peasants don't. Volkov visionary!" But nervous tells - sweating, avoiding
    eye contact, rehearsed answers. True believer or co-conspirator?
    
    **Path B: Appreciate legitimate art**
    
    Research conceptual art history: Duchamp's urinal, Klein's void, Manzoni's shit
    cans (literally). Tradition questioning "what is art?" centuries old. Volkov's
    invisible painting logical extension - if art exists mind, why need physical object?
    
    Interview philosophy professor: "Volkov brilliant. Painting invisible yes, але
    idea visible, tangible, real. Challenges commodification art, questions perception,
    democratizes experience - everyone equally unable see it! Genius meta-commentary."
    
    Gallery hopping: Compare Volkov's concept to Basel's excess - $500K shark tanks,
    diamond-encrusted skulls, urinals resold millions. Invisible painting modest actually -
    honest about emptiness capitalism fills with price tags.
    
    Meditation: Maybe missing point criticizing? Art supposed provoke, discomfort,
    question. Invisible painting doing exactly that. $12M price satirizing market itself?
    Volkov (dead/alive) laughing everyone?
    
    **Path C: Plan absurd heist**
    
    Idea strikes: Steal invisible painting. How steal nothing? Perfect crime - steal
    frame, leave invisibility? Steal invisibility, leave frame? Philosophical puzzle
    practical implications.
    
    Recruit crew (optional humor): Lockpick specialist, distraction artist, getaway
    driver, fence (how fence invisible?). Everyone confused: "Stealing WHAT exactly?"
    "Empty frame." "Why?" "Because hilarious." "Fair enough."
    
    Heist planning: Gallery security tight (protecting nothing ironic). Night operation -
    disable cameras, bypass guards, grab frame, escape. Invisibility walks out itself?
    
    Execution night: Smooth operation, frame stolen, alarms delayed. Morning discovery:
    Svetlana hysterical: "STOLEN! $12M GONE!" Police baffled: "What was stolen?" "Invisible
    painting!" "So...nothing?" "NO! PRICELESS ARTWORK!" Kafka meets Ocean's Eleven.
    
    **Path D: Observe, enjoy chaos**
    
    Step back, watch spectacle: Basel microcosm capitalism absurdity. Wealthy compete
    status symbols invisible, art world gatekeepers declare emperor clothed, media
    amplifies circus, regular people confused excluded.
    
    Document everything: Write satirical article - Basel excess, invisible painting
    perfect metaphor wealth disconnect reality, nobody admits confusion, value assigned
    arbitrarily, scam or genius distinction collapsed.

  act_two: |
    **Fraud investigation climax:**
    
    Breakthrough evidence: Volkov's cousin found Vladivostok, confirms death real -
    body identified personally, grief genuine, no faking. Svetlana knew, continued
    selling "new" works postmortem. Fraud confirmed.
    
    Confront Svetlana: Denies initially, threatens lawyers, breaks finally: "Fine!
    Viktor dead! But his IDEA lives! I'm honoring legacy, continuing vision! Art doesn't
    need living artist! Concept immortal!" Rationalization creative.
    
    Chen's involvement revealed: Ignorant, not complicit. Duped billionaire, ego prevented
    admitting. Now humiliated, furious. Sues Svetlana $12M + damages. Public embarrassment
    massive - "Tech Mogul Buys Invisible Scam."
    
    **Appreciation realization:**
    
    Philosophical acceptance: Maybe fraud? Maybe not? If Volkov's concept "art exists
    mind," Svetlana executing concept legitimately - continuing idea posthumously.
    Dead artist can't create? Or can concept outlive creator?
    
    Defend Svetlana (controversial): Write article arguing Invisible Painting legitimate
    conceptual art, death irrelevant, value subjective, market decides worth. Art
    world divided - some agree, most mock.
    
    Chen keeps painting: "I understand now. Art transcends artist. Volkov's vision
    eternal. Worth $12M? Absolutely." Genuine enlightenment or saving face? Ambiguous.
    
    **Heist aftermath:**
    
    Frame possession: You/crew have gilded frame, invisibility presumably escaped.
    Fence attempts: Gallery owners laugh, collectors confused, museums decline. Unsellable.
    
    Ransom demand (joke): "Return invisible painting $1M или destroy!" Svetlana calls
    bluff: "Destroy nothing? Go ahead!" Perfect crime becomes perfect absurdity.
    
    Final decision: Return frame anonymously, keep invisibility (free?). Or display
    own apartment, explain guests: "This invisible painting. Stole Art Basel. Long
    story." Best conversation starter ever.
    
    **Observation conclusion:**
    
    Article published: "Invisible Painting, Visible Greed: Art Basel 2028 Reflects
    Capitalism's Empty Frame." Viral - millions views, shared widely, Basel elite
    furious, regular people validated.
    
    Svetlana paradoxically benefits: Controversy increases Volkov's value, remaining
    works (visible ones) sell higher. Invisible Painting legend grows. Art market
    unaffected - contradictions sustain it.

  act_three: |
    **One year later (2029):**
    
    **Fraud exposed outcome:** Svetlana prosecuted fraud, convicted, 5 years prison.
    Volkov's estate (cousin) sues, recovers artworks. Chen's $12M refunded. Invisible
    Painting notorious scam art history. You awarded investigative journalism prize.
    Art world slightly less fraudulent (slightly).
    
    **Appreciation accepted outcome:** Invisible Painting exhibited MoMA 2029 - legitimized
    museum. Conceptual art scholars debate significance. Value increased $20M. Svetlana
    vindicated, Chen regarded visionary collector. You published philosophy art book.
    Art world unchanged - contradiction feature not bug.
    
    **Heist successful outcome:** Frame never recovered, mystery unsolved, legend grows.
    Basel security increased (protecting nothing better). You/crew infamous art world -
    only thieves steal invisible painting. Frame displayed your apartment, guests
    always ask story. Best theft ever - stole nothing, kept everything.
    
    **Observer documentation outcome:** Article becomes reference Basel excess. Quoted
    documentaries, referenced academic papers, taught media studies courses. You establish
    reputation satirist art world contradictions. Invited Basel 2029 panels - irony
    rich. Capitalism absorbs criticism, profits from it. Circle complete.

  epilogue: |
    Art world questions unanswered intentionally: What defines art? Artist or idea?
    Alive or concept? Value intrinsic or assigned? Scam or genius? Emperor clothed
    or naked? Quest doesn't resolve - presents contradictions, lets player navigate.
    
    Invisible Painting perfect metaphor: Wealth inequality visible (invisible to wealthy).
    Value arbitrary (invisible justification). Status performance (invisible substance).
    Gatekeeping culture (invisible to insiders). Capitalism's emptiness (invisible
    frame gilded).
    
    Player's choice reveals priorities: Fraud exposure values truth accountability.
    Appreciation values art philosophy. Heist values absurdist humor. Observation
    values critical distance satire. All valid, different perspectives.
    
    Satire doesn't solve contradictions, illuminates them. Art Basel continues annually,
    wealth gap widens, speculation increases, invisible paintings sold (literally metaphorically).
    Quest succeeds making visible invisible - how capitalism packages emptiness expensively,
    how culture gatekeeps arbitrarily, how people fear admitting confusion, how emperor
    parades naked while crowd applauds clothes.
    
    Volkov (dead/alive/fictional) achieved goal - art exists viewer's mind. You thinking
    about invisible painting? Then painting succeeded. $12M price tag? That's capitalism
    adding price to thoughts. Welcome Art Basel. Everything visible is invisible.
    Everything invisible is art. Nothing makes sense. That's point.

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Satirical art world quest. Social commentary sharp: Wealth inequality (invisible
    to wealthy), art market speculation (value arbitrary), cultural gatekeeping (emperor's
    clothes), capitalism contradictions (packages emptiness expensively). Invisible
    Painting perfect metaphor - literally nothing sold millions, exposes absurdity
    system. Multiple valid approaches: Fraud investigation satisfies justice, appreciation
    respects philosophy, heist embraces absurdity, observation maintains critical
    distance. No "correct" path - perspectives differ. Cyberpunk capitalism meets
    conceptual art tradition (Duchamp, Klein, Manzoni precedent real). Volkov character
    ambiguous intentionally - dead? Alive? Fictional? Doesn't matter ultimately -
    concept survives creator. Svetlana complex villain - fraud artist or legitimate
    executor vision? Both possibly. Chen sympathetic mark - insecurity drives bad
    decisions, wealth enables delusion. Heist path hilariously absurd - stealing nothing
    philosophically perfect crime. Quest doesn't resolve contradictions, illuminates
    them - satire illuminates not solves. Art Basel real event, excess documented,
    prices accurate ($3B+ sales, absurd artworks genuine examples). Educational about
    conceptual art history, art market mechanics, cultural gatekeeping dynamics, wealth
    performativity. Funny sharp thought-provoking - best satire combination. Emperor
    naked, crowd applauds clothes, player chooses acknowledge/deny/steal/observe.
