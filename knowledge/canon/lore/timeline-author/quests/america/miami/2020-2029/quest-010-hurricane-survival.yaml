  brief: |
    Hurricane Maria II. Category 5. 180 mph winds. Wealthy evacuated. Poor remain. Survive.
  
  description: |
    September 2029, Miami. Hurricane Maria II approaches - Category 5, strongest Atlantic
    storm recorded, 180 mph sustained winds, 25-foot storm surge predicted. Climate
    crisis accelerated intensity - ocean temperatures highest history, storms supercharged.
    
    Mandatory evacuation ordered 72 hours advance. Wealthy fled immediately - private
    jets, luxury hotels inland, safety guaranteed. Middle class some evacuated (traffic
    nightmare, gas shortages, hotels booked). Poor stayed - no money gas, no car,
    no relatives elsewhere, no options. Liberty City, Overtown, Little Haiti - predominantly
    Black/immigrant communities, historically neglected, infrastructure crumbling,
    flood-prone, no shelters adequate. Climate inequality visible starkest: Wealth
    buys survival, poverty death sentence.
    
    You - freelance journalist/photographer, documenting climate refugees. Chose stay -
    record reality wealthy ignore, tell stories media sanitizes, bear witness. Dangerous,
    necessary.
    
    Community center Liberty City becomes makeshift shelter: 200+ people crammed,
    families, elderly, disabled, undocumented afraid authorities, homeless nowhere
    else. Building old, reinforcement minimal, supplies insufficient. Maria II hits
    nightfall. Hours survival ahead. Leadership emerges crisis: Nurse, veteran, teenager,
    you. Decisions determine who lives, who dies. Climate crisis personal now.

  goal: |
    Survive Hurricane Maria II: Protect shelter, rescue trapped, ration supplies,
    maintain morale, navigate moral dilemmas life/death. Climate inequality confronted
    directly.

  essence: |
    Climate crisis survival quest. Inequality stark - wealthy safe, poor endangered.
    Community resilience, ordinary heroism, impossible choices. Intense, grounded,
    relevant. Not apocalypse fantasy - climate reality forecast.

story:
  background: |
    Miami hurricane history: Hurricane Andrew 1992 (Category 5, $27B damage, 65 deaths),
    Irma 2017 (Category 4, evacuation chaos), numerous smaller storms decades. Climate
    change accelerated 2020s: Ocean temps +2°C average, storm intensity +40%, frequency
    increased, unpredictability heightened. Scientists warned decades, politicians
    ignored, infrastructure investments delayed, poor communities abandoned.
    
    Liberty City demographics: 90% Black, 40% poverty rate, median income $25K (Miami
    average $55K). Historic redlining, disinvestment, environmental racism - placed
    toxic sites, denied flood protection, ignored infrastructure needs. Hurricane
    preparedness resources absent - shelters inadequate, evacuation plans nonexistent,
    building codes unenforced. Wealthy neighborhoods Miami Beach reinforced seawalls,
    elevated buildings, backup generators. Liberty City got nothing. Inequality geography.

  opening: |
    Friday 2PM, 18 hours before landfall. Community center chaos: Families arriving,
    children crying, elderly confused, supplies insufficient. Building manager Maria
    Rodriguez (55) overwhelmed: "We got maybe 50 people capacity. Already 150 here.
    More coming. Not enough food, water, blankets. Building not rated Category 5.
    Windows plywood only. Roof questionable. We're fucked."
    
    You document: Photographs families, interviews scared people, record inequality
    visual. Elder Mr. Washington (78) wheelchair-bound: "Lived Miami 78 years. Survived
    Andrew, Irma, everything. Got nowhere go now. Son wants me evacuate, but he Alabama,
    no money travel. This shelter or die home. Guess shelter."
    
    Young mother Keisha (22) three kids: "Tried evacuate yesterday. Traffic 8 hours,
    ran gas, turned back. Hotels $400 night I don't have. Gov says mandatory evacuation.
    Mandatory means forced? Or just recommendation rich people? We stay cause no choice."
    
    Leadership vacuum: Maria exhausted, staff minimal, overwhelmed. Someone needs coordinate -
    supplies, safety, morale. You step forward: "I'll help. What needs done?" Journalist
    becomes participant. Professional distance collapsed.

  act_one: |
    **6PM - 12 hours before landfall. Preparation**
    
    Inventory supplies: Food 2 days (rationed), water 3 days (stretched), medical
    kit basic, no backup power, no radios, plywood windows, questionable roof. 200+
    people, inadequate everything.
    
    Key NPCs emerge:
    
    **Nurse David Chen (34)** - ER nurse, off-duty, stayed help community. Medical
    authority, calm, competent. "Triage already. Diabetics, heart conditions, elderly -
    priority care. Limited insulin, meds running out. Hope storm passes quick."
    
    **Veteran Sam Jackson (42)** - Army combat vet, PTSD, homeless, shelter regular.
    Survival skills, leadership instinct, trauma triggers possible. "I've been worse
    situations. Afghanistan 2009. We organize, stay calm, survive. But need discipline,
    structure. People panicking kills more than storm."
    
    **Teenager Maya Rodriguez (16)** - Maria's granddaughter, tech-savvy, resourceful,
    brave. "Grandma stressed. I'll help coordinate. Got social media - posting updates,
    requesting help, documenting. Someone remember we existed."
    
    **Dilemma 1: Late arrivals**
    
    8PM: Banging door. Family 5, soaked rain (outer bands started), desperate. Shelter
    at capacity. Let them in (strain resources more), или turn away (potential death
    sentence)? Sam advocates discipline: "Rules exist reasons. Capacity means capacity."
    David advocates compassion: "We're not animals. They're humans. Make room." Maya
    records your choice (accountability). Decide.

  act_two: |
    **Midnight - Landfall begins**
    
    Winds intensify: 80 mph already, 180 mph coming. Building shakes, windows crack,
    rain horizontal, sound deafening. Power cuts. Emergency lights minimal. Children
    screaming, elderly praying, everyone terrified. Darkness, noise, helplessness.
    
    **Crisis 1: Roof breach**
    
    1AM: Section roof rips off. Rain floods second floor, 50 people there. Evacuate
    downstairs (overcrowd worse), или attempt emergency patch (risky, need volunteers
    expose storm)? Sam volunteers patch: "I'll do it. Military training. Done crazier."
    But age, PTSD, danger enormous. Allow him risk life, или forbid prioritize his
    safety? Leadership means decisions consequences.
    
    **Crisis 2: Medical emergency**
    
    2AM: Mr. Washington chest pains. Heart attack suspected. David needs insulin refrigerated (power
    out, melting), defibrillator (battery dying), ambulance (impossible storm). Options:
    Basic treatment hope survives, или risk David's life attempt hospital run (suicidal
    storm), atau accept likely death compassionate care? Impossible choice. Maria
    cries: "He's like father to me. Please save him." But risking David kills more
    potentially. Math cold, humanity warm. Decide.
    
    **Crisis 3: Structural collapse**
    
    3AM: Support beam cracks, basement flooding. Building compromised. Stay risk collapse,
    atau evacuate storm (guaranteed casualties)? Dilemma impossible - both options
    deadly. Sam assesses: "Beam holds maybe 2 hours. Storm peaks 4 hours. We're fucked
    either way." David adds: "Moving 200 people storm darkness? Elderly, disabled,
    children? Deathmarch." Maya livestreams crisis: "World needs see this. Climate
    inequality kills. We're dying here." Broadcasting desperation, atau disrespecting
    victims dignity? Journalism ethics mid-disaster murky.

  act_three: |
    **4AM - Eye of storm (brief calm)**
    
    Winds cease temporarily. 30 minutes window. Evacuation possible? Police/rescue
    visible nearby (wealthy neighborhoods prioritized first, Liberty City last). Flag
    them down, demand rescue? But capacity limited - maybe 50 people. Who evacuates?
    Elderly? Children? Disabled? Healthy? Random lottery? You decide criteria life/death.
    Moral weight crushing.
    
    **Sam's sacrifice:**
    
    Beam collapsing critically. Sam volunteers: "I'll brace it. Manually. Body weight.
    Maybe holds until rescue." Suicide mission. PTSD episodes surfacing: "Afghanistan...
    brothers died...couldn't save them...redeem now..." Martyr complex or heroism?
    Allow sacrifice or forbid? He's adult, his choice. But enabling self-destruction
    ethically complex.
    
    Decision branches:
    
    **Path A: Accept Sam's sacrifice, maximize survivors**
    
    Sam braces beam, orders evacuation. Hours holding weight, exhausted, storm resumes
    (second eyewall worse). Beam collapses finally, Sam crushed. 180 people saved
    his sacrifice. Heroic, tragic, preventable? Survivor's guilt entire shelter. Memorial
    later, but Sam dead. Worth it?
    
    **Path B: Forbid sacrifice, improvise alternative**
    
    You refuse Sam's plan: "Not losing you. We'll brace beam together, rotate shifts,
    share burden." Community effort, nobody martyred. Slower, riskier, but dignified.
    Beam holds barely, casualties higher (maybe 20 died collapse), but Sam alive.
    Collective survival, shared trauma, no heroes. Realistic.
    
    **Path C: Evacuate immediately, abandon building**
    
    Storm eye opportunity: "Everyone out NOW!" Evacuation chaos - storm resumes midway,
    casualties significant (40+). But building collapses empty after - those stayed
    died anyway. Lesser evil math brutal. Survivors traumatized, rescuers overwhelmed.
    Media blames victims: "Why didn't evacuate earlier?" Ignorance inequality willful.
    
    **Path D: Stay, pray, luck**
    
    "We stay. Shelter place. Brace beam what we can. Pray." Faith, resignation, hope.
    Beam holds miraculously (or randomly?). Casualties minimal (Mr. Washington dies,
    few others). Survival attributed prayer or luck or chance. Ambiguous. Comfort
    communities hold dear, skeptics question. Respectful portrayal both.

  epilogue: |
    **Dawn - Storm passes**
    
    Maria II gone. Devastation revealed: Liberty City underwater (10 feet), buildings
    collapsed, bodies floating, apocalyptic. Shelter survived barely. Survivors exhausted,
    traumatized, alive. Rescue teams arrive (finally) - wealthy neighborhoods cleared
    first (documentation proves), poor last. Inequality visible corpses.
    
    **One week later:**
    
    Death toll: 2,300+ Miami-Dade (mostly poor, Black, Latino neighborhoods). Federal
    response inadequate: FEMA overwhelmed, insurance companies deny claims (flood
    exclusions), rebuilding resources absent. Wealthy neighborhoods recover months,
    poor years (if ever).
    
    Your documentation: Photos/video published worldwide - inequality undeniable, climate
    crisis personalized, wealthy indifference challenged. Awards won (Pulitzer considered),
    але survivors still suffering. Journalism exposed, didn't solve. Awareness raised,
    systems unchanged. Important, insufficient.
    
    **Survivors' paths:**
    
    Maria reopens community center (rebuilt donations), continues serving. David lobbies
    healthcare climate justice, testifies Congress. Maya becomes climate activist,
    organizes youth movement. Sam (if survived) PTSD treatment, veterans outreach,
    storm trauma counseling. Mr. Washington (if died) memorial Liberty City, renamed
    park his honor.
    
    **Your reflection:**
    
    Witnessed inequality kill people directly. Climate crisis isn't abstract future -
    present reality poor communities. Wealthy escaped, poor died. Not accident, not
    natural disaster - policy failure, systemic racism, climate injustice. Survival
    determined zip code, race, wealth. American dystopia, 2029.
    
    Quest doesn't solve climate crisis (impossible). Shows human cost, challenges comfort,
    demands reckoning. Player decisions mirrored real policymakers' failures - insufficient
    resources, impossible choices, tragic consequences. Educational, activating, haunting.
    Wall of water rises. Who drowns? Who decides? Welcome climate reality.

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Climate crisis survival quest grounded. Hurricane Maria II realistic forecast -
    climate scientists predict Category 5+ storms increasingly common, Miami particularly
    vulnerable (sea level rise, flat geography, aging infrastructure). Inequality
    central theme: Wealthy evacuated easily (private jets, resources), poor trapped
    (no money, transportation, options). Liberty City real neighborhood, demographics
    accurate, historical neglect documented. Quest shows climate crisis isn't abstract
    future - present reality killing people now, disproportionately poor/Black/Latino.
    Impossible choices reflect real disaster scenarios: Limited resources, triage decisions,
    structural collapses, medical emergencies no solutions. Sam's sacrifice path explores
    martyrdom ethics - heroic or enabling self-destruction? PTSD portrayed respectfully.
    Collective survival path shows shared burden dignity. Faith path respects religious
    communities' coping mechanisms without endorsing/dismissing. Evacuation chaos
    path shows media blaming victims (real phenomenon post-Katrina). Epilogue honest -
    documentation exposes, doesn't solve. Awareness important, insufficient. Policy
    changes needed, not just individual heroism. Educational about hurricane science,
    climate inequality, disaster response failures, environmental racism. Intense,
    relevant, haunting. Not apocalypse fantasy - climate reality forecast. Wall of
    water rises. Rich escape. Poor drown. Systems fail. Heroes emerge. Survivors
    traumatized. Nothing resolved. Everything revealed. Climate justice demanded.
