        Miami's ocean barriers are the city's last defense against catastrophic flooding from rising seas.
        During a major hurricane season, the player must coordinate emergency response, repair damaged
        sections, and defend against overwhelming wave attacks to prevent total inundation.

      title: Regional Details
      body: |
        Miami 2078-2093 faces increasingly severe hurricane seasons due to climate change.
        Corporate ocean barriers combine physical structures with energy force fields to protect
        the city from flooding. During hurricanes, these barriers become battlegrounds where
        human coordination and technology fight against natural forces.
