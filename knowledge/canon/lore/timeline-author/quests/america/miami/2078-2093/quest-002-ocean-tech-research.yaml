    title: Introduction
    body: 'As Miami drowns beneath rising seas, corporations race to develop technology that could save or doom the city. An anonymous tip leads you to an abandoned underwater research facility off the coast - a place where groundbreaking ocean tech was developed before disaster struck.

But some disasters aren''t accidents. As you dive deeper, you uncover evidence that the facility''s destruction might have been sabotage - and the technology inside could change everything.'

    title: Cyberpunk Atmosphere
    body: 'Miami''s waters hide secrets beneath their turquoise surface. Sunken skyscrapers become artificial reefs, their windows reflecting holographic advertisements from the surface world. Experimental ocean tech has enhanced marine life with bioluminescent displays and unnatural intelligence.

In this submerged world, corporations wage silent wars over technology that could control the seas. Environmentalists sabotage research they deem dangerous. And you swim through it all, a ghost in the deep, uncovering truths that powerful entities want buried forever.'
