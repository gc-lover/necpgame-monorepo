    title: Introduction

    title: Cyberpunk Atmosphere
    body: 'Miami''s coastline blurs the line between luxury and danger. Million-dollar yachts cruise alongside rusted smuggling boats, their hulls reinforced with military-grade composites. The water itself seems alive with enhanced marine life - bioluminescent sharks and cybernetic dolphins that serve as living surveillance.

In this world, the sea is both ally and enemy. Corporate patrol boats with neural-linked captains hunt smugglers relentlessly. Environmental activists sabotage corporate shipping. And you weave through it all, a shadow on the waves, carrying secrets that could sink empires.'
