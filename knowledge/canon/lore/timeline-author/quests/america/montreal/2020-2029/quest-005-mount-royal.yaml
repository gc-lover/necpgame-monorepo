summary:
  brief: |
    Зеленое сердце города. Корпоративная угроза. Последний шанс защитить.

  description: |
    Mont Royal - iconic гора в центре Монреаля. Designed Frederick Law Olmsted
    (тот же кто Central Park NYC). 470 акров зеленого пространства. Chalet,
    Beaver Lake, hiking trails. Любимое место montrealers. Sacred символ города.

    Но October 2024 - Metroland Development Corp подала proposal к city council:
    "Royal Heights Project" - luxury residential complex на восточном склоне горы.
    30-этажные towers, 2000 units, "sustainable integration с nature". Reality -
    massive deforestation, trail destruction, ecosystem damage.

    Public outcry началось немедленно. "Save Mont Royal" movement. Петиции, protests,
    environmental reports. Но Metroland имеет political connections. Mayor secretly
    pro-development. Council vote через 2 недели.

    Amélie Dubois - environmental activist, leader Save Mont Royal - нанимает тебя.
    "We need evidence Metroland corrupt или illegal. Something to stop vote.
    Environmental reports они dismiss. Political pressure не работает. Only scandal
    может save mountain. Find dirt. Please."

    Investigation, infiltration, possible sabotage. Mont Royal's fate в твоих руках.

  goal: |
    Investigate Metroland Development, find evidence corruption или illegality,
    stop Royal Heights Project, preserve Mont Royal.

  essence: |
    Urban preservation quest. Corporate vs community. Environmental themes. Montreal's
    iconic landmark под угрозой. Investigation и political intrigue.

story:
  background: |
    Mont Royal - Jacques Cartier назвал в 1535. "Royal Mountain". Olmsted designed
    park в 1876. Protected landmark с 1960s. Но legal protections имеют loopholes.
    "Sustainable development" clauses могут exploit.

    Metroland Development Corp - mid-size real estate firm. CEO Richard Beaumont,
    connections к Quebec Liberal Party. Previous projects: Griffintown towers,
    Plateau condos. Always controversy, always approved. Suspected corruption,
    never proven.

  opening: |
    Sunday afternoon, Chalet Mont-Royal. Amélie встречает на terrace, overlooking
    Montreal sprawl. Fall colors gorgeous, air crisp. Groups hiking, families picnicking,
    dogs running. Peace.

    Amélie (35, fiery, passionate): "Look at this. Century protection. Public treasure.
    И Metroland хочет destroy для profit. 'Royal Heights' - grotesque name. Они
    propose 30-story towers HERE." Points at eastern slope. "2000 residential units.
    'Eco-friendly design'. Bullshit. Trees cut, trails gone, wildlife displaced.
    Just money."

    She shows proposal documents: Beautiful renderings - green walls, solar panels,
    "integrated nature". But fine print - 20 acres clear-cutting, road expansion,
    "temporary ecosystem disruption".

    "Council votes November 15. Two weeks. Metroland имеет 4 votes secured. Need
    5 для approval. Mayor swing vote - he's been quiet, но we suspect deal made.
    Environmental reports мы submitted - ignored. Protests - dismissed as NIMBY.
    We need smoking gun. Prove Metroland broke laws или bribed officials. Only
    scandal stops this."

    She desperate: "I grew up here. Learned hike этими trails. Proposed my girlfriend
    at Beaver Lake. Этот mountain - soul Montréal. Please help."

  act_one: |
    **Investigation paths**

    **Path A: Follow money**

    Research Metroland finances. Public records, building permits, tax documents.
    Discovery: Royal Heights budget $300M. But funding sources unclear. Shell companies,
    offshore accounts, suspicious loans.

    Deeper dig: One shell company - "Arctic Ventures Ltd" - majority investor. Traced
    to Cayman Islands. Ownership opaque. But corporate address matches... Mayor
    Leclerc's brother-in-law's office. Bingo.

    Conflict of interest massive. Mayor personally benefits от Royal Heights approval.
    Illegal? Technically no. Unethical? Absolutely. But enough для stop vote?

    **Path B: Environmental violations**

    Review Metroland previous projects. Griffintown towers (2019) - environmental
    impact assessment falsified. Wetlands destruction underreported. Fines paid,
    project continued. Pattern established.

    Hire independent environmental consultant review Royal Heights proposal. Findings:
    EIA severely flawed. Underestimates deforestation 300%. Ignores endangered species
    habitat. Violates Quebec Environmental Quality Act. But - whistleblower needed
    confirm fraud deliberate.

    **Path C: Infiltrate Metroland**

    Pose as potential investor или consultant. Get inside company, access internal
    documents, meetings. Risky но potentially most effective.

    Social engineering - meet Metroland VP at networking event. Fake credentials,
    tech background, interest в "sustainable urban development". Hired as consultant
    для week - Royal Heights stakeholder presentation preparation.

    Inside access: Office computers, strategy meetings, casual conversations. Overhear
    damning discussion: "Environmental protests manageable - we budgeted PR costs.
    Mayor secured, opposition fractured. Push through approval, deal with lawsuits
    after completion. Cheaper than redesign."

    Cynical, calculated. Need record as proof.

  act_two: |
    **Gathering evidence**

    Multiple approaches combined:

    **Financial smoking gun:** Arctic Ventures connection to Mayor confirmed. Paper
    trail shows $2M investment Mayor's brother-in-law's company made в Metroland
    subsidiary month before Royal Heights announced. Conflict of interest undeniable.

    **Environmental fraud:** Whistleblower found - junior environmental consultant
    forced falsify EIA. Has emails proving Metroland executives ordered data manipulation.
    Willing testify if guaranteed protection.

    **Internal recording:** Used hidden mic at Metroland strategy meeting. VP Richards
    recorded saying: "We know mountain sacred, that's why profit potential huge.
    Exclusivity sells. Environmental opposition - cost of business, factored in.
    Political donations ensured cooperation."

    Damning evidence package ready. But how use it?

    **Problem:** Council vote в 5 дней. Publishing evidence takes time - media
    verification, legal review. By time story breaks, vote already passed.

    **Alternative:** Leak evidence directly to sympathetic councilors night before
    vote. Faster, но less controlled. May backfire.

    **Or:** Confront Beaumont directly. Private meeting, show evidence, demand
    withdrawal. Blackmail essentially, но clean solution if works.

    Time ticking. Decision needed.

  act_three: |
    **Final choice - методы спасения**

    **Ending A: Media exposure**

    Release everything to Le Devoir, CBC, La Presse simultaneously. 72h before vote.
    Media storm erupts. Headlines: "Mont Royal Scandal: Mayor's Family Benefits",
    "Developer Falsified Environmental Reports". Public outrage massive.

    Emergency city council meeting. Mayor forced recuse himself. Metroland scrambles
    damage control. Three wavering councillors flip votes - protecting careers.

    Vote day: 6-2 против Royal Heights. Project cancelled. Metroland threatens
    lawsuits, но backs down (evidence too damning). Mont Royal saved. Amélie celebrates,
    Mayor announces won't seek re-election, Beaumont investigated.

    Victory complete, proper channels used. Democracy worked. Slow но thorough.

    **Ending B: Direct leak**

    Night before vote, anonymously deliver evidence packages to 3 undecided councillors.
    USB drives, printed documents, note: "Vote conscience, not connections."

    Morning meeting - panicked discussions. Councillors confront Mayor privately.
    Emergency closed session. 2 hours debate.

    Public vote: 5-3 против Royal Heights. No explanation given officially. Project
    quietly shelved. Metroland claims "economic conditions changed". Mayor remains,
    но weakened. Investigation launched later.

    Mont Royal saved. Messier victory, some corruption unpunished, но effective.

    **Ending C: Blackmail Beaumont**

    Private meeting, show evidence. "Withdraw proposal, или everything public. Your
    company destroyed, Mayor impeached, years litigation."

    Beaumont cold calculation: Fighting costs more than withdrawal. "Fine. We'll
    announce 'project reassessment'. Quietly cancel later. Evidence stays private?"

    Deal made. Next week - Metroland announces Royal Heights "postponed indefinitely
    due technical considerations". Save face, mountain saved.

    No one punished, corruption continues elsewhere, но Mont Royal protected. Pragmatic
    morally grey solution.

    **Ending D: Sabotage plans**

    Radical approach. Leak evidence BUT ALSO organize massive direct action. Occupy
    mountain, physical blockade, hundreds activists. Make development impossible
    regardless vote.

    Vote passes (Mayor pushes через), но Metroland can't access site. Weeks standoff.
    Media coverage, police reluctant forcibly remove protestors from beloved public
    space. Eventually Metroland abandons - too expensive, too controversial.

    Mont Royal saved through civil disobedience. Amélie arrested, later charges
    dropped. Folk hero status. Most dramatic victory.

    Choose your path. Legal, leak, deal, или direct action. All save mountain,
    all have costs.

  epilogue: |
    Year later - Mont Royal autumn colors brilliant. New protections passed -
    development within park boundaries permanently banned. Stronger environmental
    review requirements citywide.

    Amélie leads guided hikes educating о mountain ecology и activism history.
    Community stronger от shared struggle.

    Montreal skyline visible от Chalet terrace - towers everywhere, но this green
    heart preserved. Sometimes fighting worth it. Sometimes wins possible.
