summary:
  brief: |
    St-Viateur vs Fairmount. 70 лет rivalry. Один вердикт. Choose wisely.
  
  description: |
    Montreal знаменит двумя вещами: bagels и smoked meat. Но не просто любые -
    THE BEST. Montreal-style bagels - smaller, denser, sweeter чем NYC. Wood-fired
    ovens, boiled в honey water. Two legendary bakeries: St-Viateur (1957) и
    Fairmount (1919). Rivalry epic, passionate, delicious.
    
    И smoked meat - Montreal's answer to pastrami. Schwartz's Deli (1928) - institution.
    Line вокруг block. Но Main Deli (1974) claims better recipe. Феud decades-long.
    
    Winter 2023 - Montreal Food Festival announces: "Ultimate Food Face-Off". St-Viateur
    vs Fairmount bagels. Schwartz's vs Main smoked meat. Panel judges (including you).
    Winners crowned "Montreal's Best". Losers... devastated. Rivalry становится war.
    
    Но plot twist: Both bagel bakeries и both delis receiving threats. Anonymous
    notes: "Drop из competition или sabotage guaranteed". Someone wants specific
    winner. Or wants festival cancelled. Or worse.
    
    You're brought in: Judge competition fairly AND investigate threats. Protect
    Montreal's culinary heritage. И try не make enemies of passionate food lovers.

  goal: |

story:
  background: |
    Montreal bagels unique - smaller, denser, sweeter. Hand-rolled, boiled в honey
    water, baked в wood-fired ovens. Fairmount (1919) claims original. St-Viateur
    (1957) claims perfection. Both open 24/7. Both lines always. Friendly rivalry
    mostly, но fans PASSIONATE.
    
    Smoked meat - beef brisket, cured 10 days, smoked, steamed. Schwartz's (1928)
    legendary - Anthony Bourdain favorite. Main Deli newer, но family claims older
    recipe. Both incredible. Both claim authenticity.

  opening: |
    Monday, Festival HQ. Organizer Marie Tremblay panicked: "Thank you coming!
    Situation... complicated. Ultimate Face-Off supposed celebrate Montreal food.
    But threats started week ago."
    
    Shows notes:
    - "Fairmount drops out or ovens 'accident'. - Anonymous"
    - "Schwartz's withdraw или health inspection 'issues'. - Friend"
    - "Festival cancelled or someone hurt. - Concerned Citizen"
    
    All four establishments targeted. Police dismissive - "Food rivalry pranks".
    But Marie scared: "These places - institutions. Cannot риск harm. Но canceling
    festival - letting terrorists win. Need you judge fairly AND find who threatening.
    Please."
    
    Visit establishments:
    
    **St-Viateur Bagel** - Irwin Shlafman, 3rd generation owner: "Threats? Stupid.
    We've survived 60+ years, survive this. Competition? Bring it. We make BEST
    bagels. Judges will agree."
    
    **Fairmount Bagel** - Irwin Slavin (yes, both Irwin): "St-Viateur good, но
    WE oldest. Original recipe 1919. Competition fair? We win. Threats? Probably
    St-Viateur fans," laughs. (Rivalry good-natured mostly.)
    
    **Schwartz's** - Manager Frank Silva: "Main Deli desperate. Threatening us?
    Wouldn't surprise. Они cannot win fairly." Bitter edge.
    
    **Main Deli** - Owner Peter Varvaro: "Schwartz's имеет cult following, но our
    meat superior. Threats? Maybe Schwartz's people fear losing mystique." Defensive.
    
    Everyone suspicious of rivals. Classic.

  act_one: |
    **Competition begins - tastings**
    
    **Bagel round:** Blind tasting. Five judges including you. Criteria: texture,
    flavor, authenticity.
    
    Sample A (St-Viateur): Perfect chew. Sweet honey notes. Sesame perfect. Beautiful.
    
    Sample B (Fairmount): Slightly denser. Malty depth. Traditional feel. Incredible.
    
    Honestly? BOTH amazing. Difference microscopic. Personal preference territory.
    Other judges split 2-2. You're tiebreaker. Pressure immense.
    
    **Smoked meat round:** Same setup.
    
    Sample C (Schwartz's): Legendary spice blend. Perfect fat ratio. Melt-in-mouth.
    History в every bite.
    
    Sample D (Main): Leaner cut. Cleaner smoke flavor. Modern perfection. Outstanding.
    
    Again - both incredible. Different styles. Classic vs refined. Judges split.
    You decide.
    
    Judging postponed 24h для "deliberation". Really - investigate threats.
    
    **Investigation paths:**
    
    **Clue 1:** Handwriting analysis - all threats same person. Professional printing,
    generic paper. No fingerprints.
    
    **Clue 2:** Timing - threats started after festival announced, escalated as
    competition approached. Someone wants stop it, not win it.
    
    **Clue 3:** Security footage Mile End - suspicious person photographing all
    four establishments same day. Hoodie, sunglasses, unidentifiable. But gait
    familiar somehow.

  act_two: |
    **Sabotage attempt - real danger**
    
    Tuesday night, 2 AM. Alarm at Fairmount Bagel. Someone tried break in через
    back door. Security scared them off. Left behind: canister industrial cleaner.
    Meant contaminate dough? Or worse?
    
    Wednesday morning - St-Viateur receives package. Bomb squad called. False alarm -
    just mannequin hand holding bagel. Message: "You're next".
    
    Escalation real. Investigation urgent.
    
    **Breakthrough:** Review ALL festival participants. Not just four finalists.
    Discovery: "Best Pizza" category also happening. LaPizza Napolitana owner -
    Giuseppe Romano - furious pizza not headliner. "Bagels и smoked meat get attention,
    pizza ignored! Montreal хлебофобы ignore Italian food!"
    
    Giuseppe - hot-tempered, passionate, felt disrespected. Previous complaints
    to organizers dismissed. Motive: sabotage competition, prove festival flawed,
    demand pizza respect.
    
    Confront Giuseppe: Initially denies. Then breaks: "Fine! I sent notes! Trying
    SCARE them, not harm! Montreal pizza incredible, но everyone talks bagels bagels
    bagels! I wanted attention! Но break-in wasn't me! Swear! Just threatening notes!"
    
    Believe him? Partly. But break-in someone else. Two problems now.
    
    **Second perpetrator:** Deeper investigation reveals - rival festival organizer
    from Toronto. "TO Food Fest" lost sponsors to Montreal event. Sabotaging hoping
    Montreal festival fails, sponsors return. Corporate competition.
    
    Both culprits identified. But festival tomorrow. Decisions needed.

  act_three: |
    **Resolution - judging и justice**
    
    **Bagel judgment:** Honestly impossible pick winner objectively. Both perfect
    their way. Three choices:
    
    1. **Declare tie:** "Montreal blessed with TWO best bagel bakeries". Diplomatic,
    true, но festival wanted definitive winner.
    
    2. **Pick favorite:** St-Viateur или Fairmount. Personal taste call. Half fans
    thrilled, half angry. But honest judgment.
    
    3. **New category:** "Classic Excellence" (Fairmount) и "Modern Perfection"
    (St-Viateur). Both win, different categories. Creative solution.
    
    **Smoked meat judgment:** Same situation. Schwartz's vs Main. Legendary vs
    refined. Similar choices.
    
    **Threat resolution:**
    
    **Giuseppe:** Police want charges - criminal threatening. But he's passionate
    fool, not dangerous. Options:
    - Press charges: He faces fines, possible jail. Harsh но legal.
    - Warning: Make him apologize publicly, participate в festival properly. Merciful.
    - Ban: Exclude from festival, no charges. Middle ground.
    
    **Toronto saboteur:** Caught на camera attempting break-in. Clear criminal.
    Must face consequences. Charged, banned, sponsors informed of tactics.
    
    **Festival outcome:**
    
    If handled well - festival proceeds safely. Winners crowned (however you decided).
    Montreal food scene celebrated. Community stronger. Giuseppe learns lesson,
    eventually forgiven. Toronto rival discredited.
    
    If botched - festival chaotic, establishments angry, community divided. But
    food still amazing. Can't ruin Montreal cuisine даже with drama.
