  brief: |
    33 км туннелей. Город скрывает тайны. Некоторые живут там навсегда.
  
  description: |
    RÉSO - Montreal Underground City. 33 километров туннелей linking metro stations,
    shopping malls, office buildings, hotels. Largest underground complex в world.
    500,000 людей используют daily. Escape от brutal -30°C winters.
    
    Но есть другая Underground City. Invisible. Homeless community живущее в
    forgotten maintenance tunnels, abandoned metro sections, heating vents. Зимой -
    единственный способ survive. Summer поверхность okay, winter underground necessary.
    
    January 2026 - coldest winter в 50 лет. -35°C с wind chill. Homeless shelters
    overcrowded. Сотни людей forced underground. Но city planning major renovation -
    sealing "unauthorized access points". Closing tunnels. Forcing people в cold.
    
    Père Jean-Baptiste - Catholic priest running soup kitchen - нанимает тебя:
    "Underground community desperate. City sealing их home без alternative. Police
    sweeps arresting people. Shelters full. Люди умрут в cold. Need expose crisis,
    stop sealings, или find new solution. Please. Ils sont mes enfants."
    
    Navigate underground maze, protect vulnerable, confront bureaucracy, battle winter.

  goal: |
    Help underground homeless community, stop tunnel sealings, find housing alternatives,
    expose urban poverty crisis, prevent winter deaths.

  essence: |
    Social justice quest. Urban poverty through Montreal underground lens. Winter
    survival stakes. Bureaucracy vs humanity. Dark но important theme.

story:
  background: |
    Montreal winters brutal - average -10°C, extremes -35°C. RÉSO built 1960s для
    winter comfort. But homeless population growing - mental health crisis, housing
    unaffordability, addiction. Shelters inadequate. Underground - survival necessity.
    
    Père Jean-Baptiste (64) - 30 years serving poor. Knows underground community
    personally. Many mentally ill, addicted, но all human. Winter 2026 особенно
    опасна - polar vortex, record cold. Deaths inevitable если не action taken.

  opening: |
    Sunday, soup kitchen basement. Père Jean-Baptiste looks exhausted. "Merci
    d'être venu. This winter... worst I've seen. Shelters turn away 50+ nightly.
    Underground was refuge. Now city closing access. Last week - found Marcel frozen
    near blocked tunnel entrance. 47 years old. Couldn't get in, couldn't survive
    outside. My fault."
    
    Tears in eyes. Guilt crushing him.
    
    "City says 'safety concerns', 'unauthorized habitation', 'liability'. But WHERE
    these people go? Shelters full. Streets kill. Underground kept them alive.
    Now? Mort. Death. Need your help three things: Document conditions для media
    exposure. Negotiate с city для temporary access. Find long-term housing alternatives.
    Impossible task? Peut-être. But must try."
    
    He gives metro map marked секретными entrances: "Underground community complex.
    Not just tunnels - sections sealed years ago, forgotten maintenance areas,
    steam heating passages. Some living there 10+ years. Community established.
    Not perfect, но alive. Please help preserve that."

  act_one: |
    **Explore Underground City - both worlds**
    
    **RÉSO official:** Bright, clean, shops, restaurants, thousands commuters.
    Comfortable 20°C. Surface winter irrelevant. Consumerist underground utopia.
    
    **RÉSO unofficial:** Behind locked doors, через service corridors. Darker,
    damper, warmer (heating pipes). Makeshift shelters - cardboard, blankets,
    sleeping bags. 50+ people в различных spots. Meet community:
    
    **Marcel's widow Sylvie** (42): "My husband... froze. Blocked tunnel, nowhere
    go. We lived underground 3 years. Not ideal, но warm. Safe. Now city forcing
    out, we die. Simple math."
    
    **Tommy** (28, addict): "Trying get clean. Shelter programs need sobriety first -
    impossible. Underground gave space get myself together. Now what? Streets?
    Relapse guaranteed."
    
    **Louise** (67, schizophrenic): "Voices quieter underground. Surface too loud,
    too bright. Down here... peace. They want take my peace. Leave me alone."
    
    **Community leader Jacques** (55): "We're not criminals. We're survivors. City
    never cared underground existed until renovations planned. Now sudden 'concern'?
    Bullshit. Cost-cutting, image protection. Easier seal tunnels than house people."
    
    Document conditions: Poor но survivable. Unsanitary somewhat, но better than
    freezing. Mental illness common, addiction present, но humanity evident. These
    people trying survive impossible situation.

  act_two: |
    **Negotiations - city bureaucracy**
    
    Meet City Housing Director Michelle Beauchamp. Cold, bureaucratic: "Underground
    habitation illegal. Liability enormous. Someone injured, dies - city sued.
    Renovations necessary. Access points sealed для safety. Shelters available."
    
    Show shelter statistics - 200+ capacity, 400+ needing beds nightly. Math не работает.
    
    Michelle: "Provincial responsibility, not city. We provide what budget allows.
    Cannot enable illegal behavior. Closing tunnels proceeds March 1."
    
    Two weeks. 50+ people forced out в -30°C. Deaths inevitable.
    
    **Alternative approaches:**
    
    **Media exposure:** Contact journalists. Show underground reality. Public outrage
    может force policy change. Risk - city doubles down, accelerates closures из
    embarrassment.
    
    **Legal challenge:** Homeless advocates file injunction - temporary stop to
    sealings pending housing alternatives. Courts slow, might not rule before deadline.
    
    **Direct action:** Community organizations occupy city hall, refuse leave until
    accommodations made. Effective pressure, риск arrests.
    
    **Guerrilla housing:** Secretly create warming centers в abandoned buildings,
    церквях, temporary shelters. Illegal, но immediate. Père Jean-Baptiste willing
    risk arrest.
    
    **Hybrid solution:** Negotiate temporary "winter amnesty" - city leaves key
    access points open через March, gives time find alternatives. Practical, требует
    compromise.

  act_three: |
    **Crisis - polar vortex**
    
    February 20 - extreme weather warning. -40°C forecasted 3 days. Lethal без
    proper shelter. City accelerated tunnel sealings - closed 5 major access points
    yesterday. 30+ people displaced overnight.
    
    Emergency. Lives immediately at risk. No time bureaucracy.
    
    **Final choice:**
    
    **Ending A: Media blitz + emergency shelters**
    
    Leak everything to media. CBC, CTV, La Presse - all run stories. "Montreal's
    Hidden Homeless: Forced Into Fatal Cold." Public outrage massive. Within 48h -
    emergency funding allocated, armories opened as temporary shelters, city halts
    sealings pending review.
    
    All 50+ underground residents housed temporarily. Père Jean-Baptiste coordinates
    services. Advocacy groups mobilize long-term solutions. Crisis averted, systemic
    change begins. Clean victory, slow но thorough.
    
    **Ending B: Civil disobedience**
    
    Occupy city hall. 200+ protestors including underground residents, activists,
    clergy. Refuse leave. Police hesitant - optics terrible (arresting homeless
    during polar vortex). Standoff 36h. Mayor personally negotiates - agrees emergency
    winter housing, review policies.
    
    Dramatic, immediate, effective. Several arrests (including Père Jean-Baptiste),
    charges later dropped. Folk hero status. Direct action works.
    
    **Ending C: Guerrilla warming centers**
    
    Churches, community centers, sympathetic businesses open doors. Illegal makeshift
    shelters. City threatens closures, но public support overwhelming. De facto
    emergency network operates despite official disapproval.
    
    Underground residents survive winter. Legal battles continue, но practical
    solution implemented grassroots. City eventually accepts reality, legitimizes
    some centers. Messy but life-saving.
    
    **Ending D: Tragic compromise**
    
    Unable stop sealings in time. Polar vortex hits. Emergency services overwhelmed.
    3 deaths - exposure, hypothermia. Media coverage, public outrage после факта.
    City forced respond, opens emergency shelters, но too late для victims.
    
    Systemic change happens - increased shelter funding, mental health services,
    housing-first programs. But cost три lives. Pyrrhic victory. Guilt haunts all
    involved.
    
    Choose how fight. Time limited, stakes lethal, choices imperfect.

  epilogue: |
    Winter ends. Spring comes. Underground residents slowly transition - some to
    permanent housing, some back streets (choice или circumstances), some remain
    underground (impossible fully eliminate).
    
    RÉSO renovations complete. Tunnels brighter, safer, monitored. But small
    section - heating passage near metro Berri-UQAM - unofficially left accessible.
    Tacit agreement - city pretends not notice, community self-regulates.
    
    Père Jean-Baptiste continues работа. Aged by crisis, но strengthened by results.
    Montreal winters still brutal. But now community watches, advocates, acts.

notes:

    Heavy social justice quest. Montreal underground реально exists, homeless community
    реально использует. Winter survival real stakes. No easy answers - bureaucracy,
    funding, mental health crisis complex. Tragic ending possible - shows sometimes
    good intentions insufficient. Civil disobedience most dramatic success. Important
    theme despre urban poverty rarely represented в games.
