story:
  background: |
    Fête des Neiges running с 1984. Major Quebec winter event. Ice sculpture
    championship added 2010, grew internationally prestigious. Winners get $50K
    prize, commissions, fame. Competition fierce но traditionally respectful.
    Sabotage unprecedented.
    
    Yuki Tanaka (38) - legendary sculptor. Works displayed globally. Known для
    delicate, intricate designs. Gracious, humble, universally respected. Sabotage
    targeting him shocking.

  opening: |
    Sunday morning, Parc Jean-Drapeau. -18°C, bright sun, snow sparkling. Festival
    bustling - families sledding, kids laughing, smell smoke від bonfires. Beautiful
    winter scene. But sculpture area cordoned off - police tape, anxious artists.
    
    Yuki's sculpture - was magnificent dragon, ice scales catching light. Now -
    collapsed pile. Structural collapse от strategic melting. Yuki sitting nearby,
    devastated но composed.
    
    "Three days work. My best design. Someone... destroyed intentionally. Not
    accident. Heat lamps placed specific points overnight. Structural weak points
    targeted. Whoever did - understood ice sculpture engineering. Not random vandalism."
    
    Other competitors reactions mixed:
    
    **Sophie** (32, intense): "Terrible! Yuki deserved win. Now what? Do I win
    by default? Feels hollow. Want beat him fairly, not... this."
    
    **Dmitri** (45, aggressive): "Unfortunate. Competition continues, yes? My
    sculpture progressing well. Shame about Yuki, но... opportunities arise."
    Suspicious callousness.
    
    **Maria** (27, warm): "This breaks heart! Yuki's work inspired me start sculpting.
    Who would do such thing? We must find!" Genuine distress.
    
    Céline pulls you aside: "Yuki offered restart с new block, но time insufficient -
    competition ends tomorrow night. Unless we extend? Але other artists prepared
    для deadline. Changing rules unfair too. Nightmare situation. Find who did
    this. Quietly. Can't evacuate festival - 10,000 visitors daily."

  act_one: |
    **Investigation - gathering evidence**
    
    **Crime scene analysis:** Heat lamps positioned precisely at dragon's neck и
    base - structural weak points. Melting gradual overnight, collapse morning.
    Someone with engineering knowledge. Lamps removed после collapse - premeditated,
    careful.
    
    **Witness interviews:**
    
    Security guard Jean: "Night patrol 11 PM, 3 AM, 7 AM. Saw nothing unusual.
    Sculpture area quiet. Але... 3 AM patrol, noticed footprints near Yuki's block.
    Fresh snow fallen midnight, so tracks recent. Led від sculpture к parking lot,
    then disappeared."
    
    **Footprint analysis:** Size 10 boot, common winter wear. Но tread pattern -
    distinctive. Climbing boot, technical design. Not typical winter boot. Narrows
    suspects.
    
    **Artist alibis:**
    
    **Sophie:** Hotel room alone. No witnesses. She admits: "Couldn't sleep. Pressure
    enormous. Family expects me win - Quebec pride, proving женщина sculptor.
    Walked festival grounds 2 AM, clearing head. Saw nothing suspicious." No alibi,
    но motive questionable - wants fair win.
    
    **Dmitri:** Claims hotel bar until midnight, then room. Bartender confirms
    until 11:45 PM. Room после - alone, no verification. Known для aggressive tactics
    past - spread rumors, psychological warfare. But physical sabotage? History
    unclear.
    
    **Maria:** Shared hotel room с assistant. Both asleep. Solid alibi. Unless
    assistant lying? Unlikely - they're close friends.
    
    **Breakthrough:** Check boot treads. Dmitri's boots - regular winter. Sophie's -
    fashion boots. Maria's - regular. But... festival maintenance crew leader
    André wears climbing boots. Why maintenance crew leader here overnight?

  act_two: |
    **Twist - unexpected culprit**
    
    Confront André (52, maintenance supervisor): Initially defensive. Then breaks:
    "Fine! I did it! But NOT sabotage! Accident!"
    
    Story: André's daughter Isabelle (19) - art student, aspiring ice sculptor.
    Applied festival apprentice program - rejected. Crushed. André bitter: "Foreign
    artists get spotlight, local talent ignored."
    
    Night before collapse: André snuck Isabelle в sculpture area - private lesson,
    use professional tools, inspire her. They practiced на spare ice block nearby
    Yuki's sculpture. Set up work lamps für visibility. Finished 3 AM, забыли
    turn off ONE lamp - positioned too close Yuki's sculpture. Gradual melting
    overnight, collapse.
    
    "I swear - accident! Just wanted help my daughter. Never meant harm Yuki. Please -
    don't tell Céline. I lose job. Isabelle devastated already, learning what happened."
    
    Truth: Not malicious sabotage. Negligent accident от loving father. But result
    same - Yuki's sculpture destroyed, competition compromised. What to do?
    
    **Verification:** Check with Isabelle. She confirms, crying: "All my fault.
    Just wanted learn, practice. Papa trying help. Now ruined everything. Yuki's
    beautiful dragon... destroyed because me."
    
    Genuine remorse. But consequences remain.

  act_three: |
    **Resolution - justice и mercy**
    
    **Option A: Report fully**
    
    Tell Céline, police, Yuki everything. André fired, possibly charged (criminal
    negligence?). Isabelle's sculpting dreams crushed - scandal attached. Harsh
    але factual. Competition extended 2 days, Yuki given new block, completes
    magnificent phoenix. Wins championship. Justice served, dreams destroyed.
    
    **Option B: Arrange private resolution**
    
    Bring André, Isabelle, Yuki together privately. André apologizes, offers pay
    damages (can't afford much). Yuki listens, then: "Accidents happen. I know
    loving parent desperation. Isabelle - you want learn ice sculpture? After
    festival, I teach you. Properly. Apprenticeship."
    
    Mercy over justice. André keeps job, Isabelle gets dream apprenticeship. Yuki
    withdraws from competition (cannot complete time), but Sophie wins fairly.
    Everyone grows. Forgiving ending.
    
    **Option C: Competition extension**
    
    Convince Céline extend competition без revealing André. Claim "investigation
    ongoing, fairness requires extension". All artists given 2 extra days. Yuki
    completes new sculpture - even better than dragon. Sophie also improves hers.
    Final result: Yuki wins (talent prevails), Sophie second (proud effort), Maria
    third (exceeded expectations). André's secret safe, lesson learned privately.
    Pragmatic solution.
    
    **Option D: Expose conspiracy**
    
    Dig deeper - discover Dmitri actually bribed André before incident, planted
    idea о late-night practice near Yuki's sculpture. Psychological manipulation,
    plausible deniability. Dmitri real villain, André pawn. Expose both - Dmitri
    disqualified, banned, André fired. Sophie wins championship, somewhat hollow
    but legitimate. Dark truth revealed.
    
    Choose: Full justice, mercy, pragmatism, или deeper investigation. Each path
    different costs.

  epilogue: |
    Competition concludes. Winner crowned (depends на path). Festival continues,
    visitors oblivious to drama. Ice sculptures eventually melt - nature of medium.
    Transient beauty. But memories, lessons, relationships - те remain.
    
    Yuki continues sculpting globally. If mercy chosen - Isabelle becomes his
    apprentice, eventually renowned sculptor herself. André learns trust proper
    channels. Sophie proves herself regardless outcome. Maria gains exposure, career
    flourishes.
    
    Winter returns annually. So does Fête des Neiges. Scandals forgotten, beauty
    remembered.
