    500+ concerts, 2+ million visitors. Downtown transformed - stages everywhere,
    music 24/7, crowds massive. Pure celebration.
    
    July 2025 - festival особенный: Dizzy Gillespie's original trumpet on display -
    museum loaned для 50th anniversary tribute. Priceless. Behind bulletproof glass,
    24/7 security, motion sensors, crowds constant.
    
    Enter Marcus "Jazz Hands" Williams - gentleman thief, jazz aficionado, insufferable
    romantic. Wants steal trumpet не для money - для "art". Plans return после,
    just wants play it один раз at sunrise on Mount Royal. Dream of lifetime.
    Insane plan. Impossible heist. Perfect for you.
    
    Marcus offers cut: "Help steal trumpet tonight. Play sunrise. Return afternoon.
    Nobody hurt, nothing damaged, museum gets publicity boost. Win-win-win. Plus -
    you'll hear Dizzy's horn played как meant to be. Offer expires в 6 часов."
    
    Moral dilemma: Help romantic fool или stop him? Either way - festival doesn't stop.

  goal: |
    Either: Help Marcus steal trumpet, ensure safe return OR Stop heist, protect artifact.
    Festival continues regardless. Jazz eternal.

  essence: |
    Light heist quest. Jazz festival atmosphere. Charming rogue protagonist. Improvisation

story:
  background: |
    Montreal Jazz Fest started 1980. Now legendary - Herbie Hancock, Miles Davis,
    Ella Fitzgerald performed. Free outdoor concerts, paid indoor shows. Downtown
    closed to traffic, становится pedestrian music paradise. Atmosphere euphoric.
    
    Marcus Williams (41) - career thief, но classy. Steals art, returns после
    ransom или exposure. Loves jazz obsessively. Considers himself "Robin Hood
    of culture" - makes art accessible briefly, returns unharmed. Police hate him,
    но public somewhat charmed. Never violent, never greedy, just... eccentric.

  opening: |
    Tuesday evening, Place des Arts. Festival в full swing - stages blasting music,
    crowds dancing, street performers, food vendors, pure energy. Summer night perfect.
    
    Marcus approaches you casual: "Beautiful evening, non? Jazz fills soul. Speaking
    of - appreciate moment of time?"
    
    He's smooth, charismatic, wearing vintage suit. Explains plan:
    
    "Dizzy's trumpet - over there, Musée d'art contemporain. Security tight, ale
    festival chaos creates... opportunities. Tonight - Herbie Hancock tribute concert
    headliner. Every security guard, police officer, person alive - watching. Peak
    distraction. Small window - 11:04 to 11:19 PM exactly. 15 minutes security
    shift change, concert climax, maximum chaos. Steal trumpet, disappear в crowd,
    meet sunrise Mount Royal, play 'A Night in Tunisia', return afternoon museum
    steps. Poetry."
    
    You: "Why tell me? Why involve?"
    
    Marcus: "Because you're capable. Because share love of music? Because need
    brilliant partner? Take pick. I offer 50% profits - wait, no profits. I offer
    HONOR. Experience. Story eternal. What say?"
    
    Can refuse - walk away, inform police, stop heist. Can accept - greatest jazz
    fest heist в history. Decision yours. Clock ticking - 4 hours until window.

  act_one: |
    **Path A: Join heist**
    
    Marcus delighted: "Excellent! Now - reconnaissance."
    
    Case museum: Dizzy's trumpet center display, bulletproof case, pressure sensors
    below, motion detectors, two guards visible, cameras 6 angles, crowd 200+ gawking.
    Impossible traditional approach.
    
    Marcus plan: "Improvisation! Jazz spirit - adapt, flow, create. We don't break
    in. We become environment."
    
    **Step 1: Impersonate festival staff**
    
    Acquire credentials - legitimate или fake. Festival staff everywhere, badges
    скупают trust. Marcus has contacts - forger nearby. 500$ each badge. OR steal
    real badges (riskier но cheaper). OR convince actual staff let you "help" (charm
    skill).
    
    **Step 2: Create bigger distraction**
    
    Herbie concert good, но not enough. Need ADDITIONAL chaos. Options:
    - Stage spontaneous jam session near museum - draw crowd, guards
    - "Fire alarm" - evacuate area (too obvious?)
    - Celebrity sighting rumor - redirect crowds elsewhere
    - Technical malfunction major stage - all attention shifts
    
    Marcus favors jam session: "More jazz, more beautiful. We create art WHILE
    stealing art. Meta!"
    
    **Step 3: Bypass security**
    
    Case alarm - pressure sensor, motion detector, glass. Marcus has mini EMP device -
    shorts electronics 90 seconds. Glass stays - cut circular hole (diamond cutter,
    quiet, 45 seconds). Pressure sensor - replace trumpet с exact weight replica
    before removing. Motion detector - frozen от EMP. Tight sequence, zero room error.
    
    11:04 PM - action begins.

  act_two: |
    **Heist execution - improvisation required**
    
    Everything starts perfect: Staff badges work. Jam session erupts - crowd diverts.
    Herbie concert climactic. Security shift change. Window open.
    
    Then - complications (jazz spirit!):
    
    **Complication 1:** Museum guard Henri - supposed leave during shift change,
    STAYS. He's jazz fanatic, wants hear Herbie finish. Blocking path.
    
    Options: Convince him leave (diplomacy), distract (send fake urgent message),
    knock out (risky, Marcus hates), wait him out (cuts time dangerously).
    
    **Complication 2:** Tourist kid Antoine (9) wanders near heist. Curious, innocent,
    might see everything. Parents distracted by concert.
    
    Options: Guide him away gently, let him watch (he stays quiet?), his presence
    actually provides cover (family looks innocent).
    
    **Complication 3:** EMP shorts museum lights too - unexpected. Darkness helps
    stealth, но crowd panics slightly. Glass cutting noise louder в silence.
    
    Adapt fast. Pure improvisation. Marcus grins: "Now it's REAL jazz!"
    
    If handled well: Trumpet stolen clean. 11:17 PM - 2 minutes spare. Disappear
    в festival crowd. Nobody notices missing trumpet until morning.
    
    **Path B: Stop heist**
    
    Inform festival security discreetly. Setup counter-operation. When Marcus attempts
    heist - caught red-handed. Police arrest him mid-theft. He doesn't resist,
    smiles: "Figured risk. C'est la vie."
    
    Trumpet safe. Festival continues. You get security consultant fee. Responsible
    choice. Boring story. Marcus respectful: "Played your part well. Improvised
    differently. Still jazz."

  act_three: |
    **Sunrise - Mount Royal (if heist succeeded)**
    
    4:45 AM. Drove Mount Royal peak. City lights twinkling below. Sky purple-orange.
    Few joggers, dog walkers, dawn lovers. Peaceful.
    
    Marcus holds Dizzy's trumpet reverently. "Moment lifetime. Thank you." Puts
    lips к mouthpiece. Pauses. "Scared. What if I'm terrible? Ruin moment?"
    
    You: "Then you're terrible. Still tried."
    
    He plays. "A Night in Tunisia". Not perfect - technique shaky, breath control
    lacking. But FEELING - oh, feeling there. Pure, authentic, beautiful. Sunrise
    breaks during solo. Sky lights gold. Moment transcendent.
    
    Few morning people stop, listen, applaud. They don't know trumpet priceless.
    Just appreciate music. Perfect.
    
    Marcus finishes. Tears streaming. "Worth it. Everything worth it."
    
    **Return:**
    
    Noon. Museum steps. Anonymous delivery - trumpet в original case, note: "Borrowed
    briefly. Returned safely. Dizzy would approve. - A Fan."
    
    Media circus. Museum director furious но relieved. Police baffled. Public amused.
    Trumpet undamaged, actually polished. Festival gains publicity. Nobody hurt.
    Victimless crime? Perhaps.
    
    Marcus disappears. Sends you postcard week later: "Until next impossible dream.
    - Jazz Hands."

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Light heist quest. Marcus charming rogue - neither hero nor villain. Moral
    ambiguity intentional. Heist path more rewarding (XP, story), но stop path
    valid choice. Improvisation theme matches jazz spirit. Sunrise scene beautiful
    payoff. Victimless crime - player decides ethics. Montreal Jazz Fest real,
    atmosphere captured. No combat ever - pure stealth, charm, cleverness.
