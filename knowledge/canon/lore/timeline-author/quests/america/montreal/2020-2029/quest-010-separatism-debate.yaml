story:
  background: |
    Quebec - unique в North America. French-speaking province в English-dominant
    continent. History: New France (1534-1763), British conquest, Confederation
    1867, Quiet Revolution 1960s. Always maintained distinct identity.
    
    Separatist movement - protecting French language, culture, sovereignty. Federalist
    position - stronger together, Canadian identity inclusive. Both sides passionate,
    legitimate arguments. Not good vs evil - competing visions future.

  opening: |
    Monday morning, Sophie's production studio. She's Franco-Ontarian - French
    heritage, outside Quebec - perfect "neutral" observer. Explains project:
    
    "Referendum три недели. World watching. But media coverage... superficial.
    'Quebec votes yes or no' - meaningless. WHY people vote? What drives them?
    Fears, hopes, identity, economics? Need capture nuance. That's where you come
    in."
    
    Shows interview list - 8 people, diverse backgrounds, perspectives ranging.
    Your job: conduct interviews professionally, let people speak truth, no judgment.
    
    "Some interviews easy. Some... passionate. Stay neutral. Your reactions matter -
    даже small judgments bias documentary. Can handle?"
    
    You agree. First interview: tomorrow.

  act_one: |
    **Interviews - sovereigntist perspectives**
    
    **Interview 1: Marie-Claude Beauchamp** (54, history teacher, lifelong separatist)
    
    Location: Café Plateau Mont-Royal. Speaks entirely French.
    
    "Je me souviens. Our motto - 'I remember'. Remember что? New France. British
    conquest. Every battle preserve language, culture. My grand-mère forced speak
    English at work - humiliated. 1960s, we said 'Non!' Quiet Revolution. Bill 101 -
    French official language. Progress. Але insufficient.
    
    Canada treats us token. 'Bilingual' federally, но really English dominates.
    Outside Quebec, French disappearing. Quebec alone preserves. To protect fully -
    need sovereignty. Own country, own laws, own future.
    
    Not hatred Canada. Respect. But different nations. Quebecois nation deserves
    self-determination. Referendum - chance become masters our house."
    
    Passionate, articulate, emotional. Not angry - determined. Believes deeply.
    
    **Interview 2: Thomas Gagnon** (29, tech entrepreneur, pragmatic sovereigntist)
    
    Location: His startup office, Griffintown.
    
    "Look - not my grand-parents' separatism. Not about revenge, past grievances.
    About future. Quebec has resources, talent, innovation. But federal system -
    slow, bureaucratic, compromises necessary.
    
    Independent Quebec - agile, responsive, competitive. Scandinavian model - small
    country, highly developed, socially progressive. We could be Nordic nation North
    America. Better than current setup где Ottawa decides half our policies.
    
    Yes, risks. Transition difficult. But long-term? Better. Younger generation
    sees possibilities, not fears. Time try something new."
    
    Less emotional, more analytical. Represents new sovereigntism - economic, pragmatic.

  act_two: |
    **Interviews - federalist perspectives**
    
    **Interview 3: Robert Thompson** (61, anglophone business owner)
    
    Location: His downtown store.
    
    "My family here 150 years. I'm Quebecer too. Born Montreal, love this city.
    But separation? Disaster. Economically catastrophic - businesses flee, investment
    drops, currency issues, trade complications.
    
    Culturally divisive - what about anglophones, immigrants, First Nations? We're
    30% population. Where we fit independent Quebec? Second-class citizens?
    
    Canada works. Imperfect? Sure. But federation allows diversity, protections,
    prosperity. Quebec has autonomy already - language laws, civil code, immigration
    control. Best of both worlds.
    
    Referendum not about identity. About practical governance. Sovereignty sounds
    romantic. Reality? Messy, expensive, divisive. Vote non."
    
    Concerned, pragmatic. Not anti-French - anti-separation. Fears consequences.
    
    **Interview 4: Aisha Osman** (35, immigrant from Somalia, now Canadian)
    
    Location: Community center, Côte-des-Neiges.
    
    "Arrived Quebec 2015. Refugee. Canada saved my life. Quebec welcomed, provided
    services, language training. Now citizen, grateful.
    
    Referendum confusing. I learned French, integrated, love Quebec culture. But
    also proud Canadian. Why choose? Why separate?
    
    Immigrant community worried. Independent Quebec - still welcoming? Immigration
    policies change? Status unclear. Most immigrants vote federalist - uncertain
    what sovereignty means for us.
    
    Quebec has problems - discrimination, inequality. But separating не solves.
    Work together solves. Canada stronger united."
    
    Vulnerable, uncertain. Represents immigrant perspective - часто overlooked.

  act_three: |
    **Interviews - undecided и complex positions**
    
    **Interview 5: Jean Tremblay** (48, factory worker, Bloc supporter federally,
    uncertain on referendum)
    
    Location: Dépanneur parking lot, working-class neighborhood.
    
    "Politicians talk identity, economics, culture. Fine. But me? Work factory 25
    years. Bills need pay. Kids need feed.
    
    Sovereignty - costs money short-term? Probably. Long-term better? Maybe. Big
    gamble. I gamble paycheck, my family security.
    
    Also - emotionally? Feel Quebecois first, Canadian second. Proud heritage. But
    scared uncertainty. Wife says vote oui. Brother says non. Me? Deux semaines
    decide.
    
    Referendum supposed democratic. Feels like choosing sides civil war. Hate that.
    Want best для Quebec. Just... don't know what 'best' is."
    
    Torn, honest, represents silent middle. Most relatable interview.
    
    **Interview 6: Nakuset** (42, Indigenous activist, Mohawk Nation)
    
    Location: Native Friendship Centre.
    
    "Quebec sovereignty? Ironic. Quebec demands self-determination from Canada. Fair.
    But what about Indigenous self-determination from Quebec?
    
    We're First Nations. Here thousands years before France, Britain, Canada, Quebec.
    Our land. Yet Quebec referendum ignores us. Assumes territory automatically
    goes с Quebec independence. Says who?
    
    If Quebec sovereign, we negotiate separately. Our territories, our resources,
    our governance. Not Quebec's property. Not Canada's property. Ours.
    
    Both sides referendum talk rights, respect, self-determination. Good. Apply
    same principles Indigenous peoples. Until then? Referendum hollow."
    
    Powerful, challenging. Shifts entire frame debate. Often forgotten perspective.

  epilogue: |
    **Final reflection interview - Sophie asks you**
    
    All interviews complete. Documentary editing begins. Sophie interviews YOU:
    
    "You met eight people. Heard perspectives. What think? No wrong answer. Just
    honest reflection."
    
    **Your response options:**
    
    **A: Sovereigntist lean**
    "Sovereignty arguments compelling. Self-determination important. Quebec distinct
    nation. Understand desire control future."
    
    **B: Federalist lean**
    "Federation provides stability, prosperity. Diversity strength. Separation risky,
    divisive. Better together."
    
    **C: Undecided**
    "Both sides legitimate points. Complex issue. Respect democratic process. No
    easy answer."
    
    **D: Indigenous priority**
    "Referendum framework flawed. Indigenous sovereignty ignored. Cannot discuss
    Quebec self-determination while ignoring First Nations rights."
    
    **E: Abstain judgment**
    "Not my decision. I'm observer. Quebecers choose. I documented, listened. That's
    role."
    
    Each response valid. Shapes documentary tone somewhat. But ultimately - Quebec
    decides.
    
    **Referendum day:**
    
    November 2027. Record turnout. Hours counting. Nation watches. Results: [Left
    ambiguous - player's world can decide]. Either way - Quebec continues. Democracy
    works. Debate permanent probably. That's okay. Complicated questions deserve
    ongoing dialogue.

notes:

    Heavy political quest. Requires respectful treatment all perspectives. No
    "correct" answer - both sovereignty и federation legitimate positions. Indigenous
    perspective critical inclusion - often forgotten в referendum debates. Player
    can lean any direction або abstain judgment. Educational about Quebec history,
    politics. Dialogue-heavy, no combat ever. Referendum result deliberately ambiguous -
    player's world decides. Important: quest не propaganda either side. Shows
    complexity, humanity, legitimate concerns all perspectives.
