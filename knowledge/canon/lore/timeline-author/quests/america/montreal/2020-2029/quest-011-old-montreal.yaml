summary:
  brief: |
    Vieux-Montréal. 400 years cobblestones. Developer wants condos. Archaeologist
    найдёт treasure. Stop или profit?
  
  description: |
    Old Montreal - historic heart города. Cobblestone streets, 17th-century buildings,
    Notre-Dame Basilica, Place Jacques-Cartier. Preserved beautifully. UNESCO
    consideration. Tourist magnet.
    
    April 2024 - development company "Nouvelle Vision" получает approval построить
    luxury condos в Old Port area. Controversial - historical purists furious,
    developers argue "controlled modernization". City council split decision.
    
    Construction begins. Week later - archaeologist Dr. Émilie Rousseau discovers:
    buried French colonial settlement remains. 1640s artifacts, building foundations,
    possibly массовое захоронение. Historically invaluable. Legally - stops construction.
    
    Developer CEO Richard Fontaine furious: "Delays cost millions! These rocks
    meaningless. Build over, preserve через photos. Progress cannot stop для rubble."
    
    Heritage Quebec demands full excavation, preservation. Months delay minimum,
    possibly permanent stop. Financial disaster для Fontaine.
    
    Fontaine approaches you privately: "Make artifacts disappear. 500K$. Quietly.
    Rousseau goes away, construction proceeds, everyone wins." Bribery blatant.
    
    Alternatively - help Rousseau protect site, expose corruption, save history.
    Money или memory. Choose.

  goal: |
    Decide: Help developer destroy evidence и profit OR Protect archaeological site,
    expose corruption, preserve heritage.

  essence: |
    Preservation vs profit quest. Montreal history tangible. Bribery offer direct.
    Moral choice consequences clear. Investigation, decision, action.

story:
  background: |
    Old Montreal founded 1642 - Ville-Marie. French colonial settlement. Montreal
    grew от там. Modern city built over layers history. Occasionally construction
    reveals past - usual protocol: archaeology assessment, preservation если significant.
    
    Dr. Émilie Rousseau (39) - respected archaeologist. Published, ethical, passionate
    preservation. Discovery career-defining. Fonтаine Richard (52) - ruthless developer.
    Made fortune gentrification. Connected politically. Used delays crushing.

  opening: |
    Tuesday morning, construction site. Yellow police tape, workers idle. Excavation
    pit visible - stone foundations exposed, artifacts flagged, excitement palpable.
    
    Dr. Rousseau показывает finds: "Look - French ceramics, 1640s. Building foundations
    aligned historical maps Ville-Marie. Possibly original settlement structures.
    And here -" points deeper pit, "- skeletal remains. Mass burial? Disease outbreak?
    Battle? Unknown yet. But historically invaluable. This где Montreal began."
    
    She glows enthusiasm. History alive для неё.
    
    Heritage Quebec representative Claude Mercier present: "Site protected now.
    Full excavation required. Months minimum. Developer notified."
    
    Fontaine arrives, furious. Sees you watching. Later, approaches discreetly:
    
    "You were там. Saw circus. Rousseau making mountains från rocks. Delays kill
    project. Banks nervous. Partners threatening. I researched you - capable, discreet.
    Proposal: 500K$ cash. Make problem disappear. Contaminate site, discredit
    Rousseau, lose artifacts, whatever works. Just REMOVE obstacle. Interested?"
    
    Blatant. Illegal. Profitable. Tempting?
    
    Decision time.

  act_one: |
    **Path A: Accept bribe - destroy evidence**
    
    500K$ significant money. Rousseau's discovery... bones and rocks. Montreal
    survives. Condos house people today. Progress matters. Justify easily.
    
    Fontaine provides: Site access, security bypass, contamination materials (industrial
    chemicals break preservation), falsified reports (ready plant). Plan:
    
    1. Night entry - security complicit
    2. Chemical treatment artifacts - renders dating impossible, historical value lost
    3. "Accidentally" damage foundation structures - appear natural erosion
    4. Plant modern debris mixed - contaminate archaeological context
    5. Anonymous tip Rousseau's methodology flawed - discredit
    
    Execute carefully - site ruined archaeology perspective. Heritage Quebec reassesses -
    "insufficient historical significance". Construction resumes. You 500K$ richer.
    
    Rousseau devastated - career setback, historical loss. But she'll recover.
    Fontaine thrilled. Montreal gets condos. History? Forgotten.
    
    **Path B: Refuse bribe - help Rousseau**
    
    500K$ tempting. But history? Priceless. Montreal's origin story buried там.
    Cannot destroy для profit.
    
    Tell Rousseau about bribe offer. She's shocked: "He'd destroy heritage? Criminal!"
    Plan response:
    
    1. Document bribe offer - record conversations, evidence collection
    2. Accelerate excavation - prove significance undeniable
    3. Public exposure - media, social media, make site famous
    4. Legal action - charges against Fontaine bribery, heritage destruction attempt
    
    Work с Rousseau - uncover MORE: Mass grave BIGGER than thought, 50+ skeletons,
    evidence 1643 typhoid outbreak, historically documented epidemic, burial site
    matching records. Invaluable.
    
    Also find: Original foundation stone - "Ville-Marie, 1642, Maisonneuve" carved.
    Literally Montreal's birth certificate in stone. Photos go viral. Public support
    overwhelming.

  act_two: |
    **Fontaine escalates (both paths potentially)**
    
    **If helped destroy:** Fontaine pleased initially. Then paranoid - you know
    crimes, liability. Attempts silence you - threats, then assassination attempt
    (hired goons). Defend yourself, survive. Realize - dirty money brings dirty
    problems. Cannot trust criminal partner. Regret sets in.
    
    **If refused:** Fontaine desperate. Construction halted indefinitely, financial
    collapse imminent. Attempts destroy site himself - night attack, brings construction
    equipment, tries bury excavation. You и Rousseau intercepted - dramatic confrontation.
    
    Site surrounded - police, media, protestors. Fontaine caught red-handed. Arrested -
    bribery, heritage destruction, assault charges. Spectacular fall.
    
    Public vindication. Site saved. Rousseau hero. Montreal's history preserved.

  act_three: |
    **Consequences - long term**
    
    **Ending A: Destroyed site**
    
    Condos built. Luxury apartments, expensive, empty mostly (investors). Old Port
    "modernized". History erased. You 500K$ richer но haunted. Rousseau left archaeology -
    heartbroken. Heritage Quebec weakened - precedent set, developers emboldened.
    Montreal loses piece soul.
    
    Money spends, but guilt remains. Was worth it? You decide. Cannot undo.
    
    **Ending B: Preserved site**
    
    Site becomes protected monument. Full excavation reveals incredible finds -
    complete 17th-century settlement, artifacts museum-quality, mass grave properly
    honoured, First Nations trade goods (evidence Indigenous relations).
    
    Designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. Museum built on-site - "Birthplace of
    Montreal". Tourist attraction, educational center, heritage preserved.
    
    Rousseau directs museum. Fontaine imprisoned. You hailed hero preservation community.
    Reputation boost massive. Legacy positive.
    
    Montreal's history protected. Future generations learn. Worth infinitely more
    than 500K$.

  epilogue: |
    Years later, walk Old Montreal. Cobblestones под ногами - same stones walked
    centuries. History живёт в камнях, buildings, streets.
    
    If destroyed site - condos tower, anonymous. Nobody remembers what lost.
    
    If preserved - museum thriving. Children learning. History alive.
    
    Choose які Montreal inherit. Stones remember.

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Stark moral choice. 500K$ tempting, но heritage priceless. Accept bribe path
    intentionally unrewarding - negative XP, guilt, danger. Preservation path deeply
    rewarding - XP, reputation, legacy, UNESCO designation. Choice clear consequences.
    Fontaine escalates either path - crime doesn't pay stable. Real Montreal history
    referenced - Ville-Marie 1642, French colonial, typhoid epidemic 1643. Archaeological
    discoveries Montreal real phenomenon. Heritage vs development ongoing tension
    Quebec. Heavy theme но important.
