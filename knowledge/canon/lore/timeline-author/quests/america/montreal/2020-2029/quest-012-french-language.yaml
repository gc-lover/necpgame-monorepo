story:
  background: |
    French в North America endangered. Canada bilingual federally, але outside Quebec,
    French declining. Quebec 8 million people - only French-majority jurisdiction
    continent. Bill 101 ensured survival. But global English dominance constant pressure.
    
    Montreal unique - 50% francophone, 25% anglophone, 25% allophone (other languages).
    Language daily negotiation. Most bilingual city, але tension remains.

  opening: |
    Monday, immigration office. Letter arrived: "Work permit renewal requires French
    proficiency demonstration. Interview scheduled October 15. Failure результирует
    status review."
    
    Panic sets. Your French... minimal. "Bonjour, merci, où est" level. Insufficient.
    Six weeks improve или face deportation? Stressful.
    
    Simultaneously - contact от documentarian Michel Tremblay: "Bill 101-Revised
    documentary. Need someone interview subjects, edit narratives. Pays well. Interested?"
    
    Perfect timing - need money для French lessons, PLUS understand law affecting you.
    Accept project. Michel provides subject list:
    
    1. **Louise Gagnon** (62) - retired teacher, Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste member,
    French protection fierce advocate
    2. **David Cohen** (35) - anglophone business owner, feels targeted by law
    3. **Priya Patel** (28) - Indian immigrant, learning French third language,
    struggling adapt
    
    Interview them, document perspectives, survive yourself. Go.

  act_one: |
    **Personal struggle - learning French**
    
    Enroll intensive course. Teacher Mme. Lefebvre (68, strict, passionate): "Français
    n'est pas seulement langue. C'est âme Quebec. You learn words? Non. You learn
    culture, history, identity. Then language comes."
    
    Classes brutal. Grammar complex - gendered nouns, subjunctive mood, liaison
    rules. Pronunciation difficult - 'r' sounds, nasal vowels, elision. Vocabulary
    vast. Frustrating, exhausting, essential.
    
    Practice everywhere - order coffee français, read Le Devoir, watch Radio-Canada,
    speak locals. Some patient, encouraging. Others judgmental, dismissive if accent
    wrong. Language learning public performance. Vulnerable.
    
    Progress slow but real. Basic conversation achievable. Complex discussions? Still
    English needed. But trying. That counts somewhat.
    
    **Interview 1: Louise Gagnon - La Protectrice**
    
    Her home, Rosemont neighborhood. Photos wall - Quiet Revolution, René Lévesque,
    language protests. Speaks только French entire interview.
    
    "Monsieur, vous comprenez pourquoi Bill 101 necessary? Non? Let me explain.
    Before 1970s, francophones second-class own province. English boss, French worker.
    English education rich, French education poor. Français dying.
    
    Bill 101 saved us. Made French normal, expected, protected. Now children grow
    proud their language. Work français, live français, dream français. Beautiful.
    
    Bill 101-Revised? Necessary! English everywhere - internet, movies, business,
    creeping back. Young people speaking franglais - mixed code. Losing purity.
    Must strengthen protections or lose everything we built.
    
    You struggle learn French? Good! That's integration. You want live Quebec, must
    speak our language. Not oppression - survival. Understand?"
    
    Passionate, defensive, але sincere. Genuinely believes language survival stake.

  act_two: |
    **Interview 2: David Cohen - Le Résistant**
    
    His store, Mile End. English signage (grandfathered pre-1977). Speaks English
    primarily, French functional.
    
    "Look, I'm fourth generation Montreal. My family here longer than half francophones.
    Anglo-Quebecer legitimate identity. We're not 'immigrants', not 'colonizers' -
    we're HOME.
    
    Bill 101? I understand... initially. 1977, francophones discriminated against,
    needed protection. Fair. But now? Overkill. French не endangered Quebec. Dominant.
    Thriving. Yet laws tighten constantly.
    
    Bill 101-Revised treats English speakers enemies. My business? Operates bilingually.
    Clients choose language. Works fine. But new law требует French-first everything,
    penalties если employee speaks English intern meetings. Orwellian!
    
    Not asking special treatment. Asking coexistence. Montreal historically bilingual.
    That's strength, not weakness. Why erase that?
    
    Young anglos leaving - Toronto, Vancouver, US. Brain drain. Quebec loses talent
    because language police obsessed purity over practicality."
    
    Frustrated, defensive, але not anti-French. Wants space для bilingualism. Feels
    squeezed out.
    
    **Interview 3: Priya Patel - L'Apprenante**
    
    Coffee shop, Parc Extension. Speaks English fluent, French broken, Hindi mother
    tongue.
    
    "I came Canada 2022. Chose Quebec because immigration process faster, province
    needs workers. Okay, fine. But nowhere explained French requirement THIS intense.
    
    Learning third language adult? Hard! Already bilingual - Hindi, English. Now
    French mandatory. Government offers courses, але full-time job + parenting +
    household = when find time?
    
    Francophone neighbors kind sometimes, judgmental others. "Why English?" they
    ask, annoyed. Because easier! Learned school India! Not refusing French - just...
    need time.
    
    Bill 101-Revised scares me. What if fail test? Deportation? Son born here - citizen.
    Me? Resident. Family split? Over language?
    
    Understand protecting French. Respect deeply. But mercy also? Immigrants trying
    best. Need support not punishment."
    
    Vulnerable, sympathetic, caught middle. Represents immigrant struggle often ignored.

  act_three: |
    **French test - personal crisis**
    
    October 15. Immigration interview. Test: conversation 20 minutes French. Topics
    random. Must demonstrate proficiency.
    
    Officer (stern): "Bonjour. Asseyez-vous. Nous allons parler français seulement.
    Commençons. Pourquoi voulez-vous rester au Québec?"
    
    Skill check - accumulated learning. If practiced diligently: pass. If minimal
    effort: struggle, borderline. Officer assesses comprehension, speaking ability,
    cultural integration attempt.
    
    Pass = work permit renewed, stay Quebec, relief enormous.
    Fail = status review, possible deportation, devastating.
    
    Result depends player effort throughout quest. Language learning real stakes.
    
    **Documentary release - public reaction**
    
    Michel completes documentary using your interviews. Balanced, respectful, shows
    all sides. Released October 20, weeks before Bill 101-Revised vote.
    
    Public response mixed:
    - Francophones appreciate Louise's perspective, some find David's legitimate
    - Anglophones relate David, some acknowledge Louise's fears valid
    - Immigrants overwhelmingly identify Priya, demand accommodation
    
    Documentary sparks dialogue. Not changes minds necessarily, але humanizes debate.
    People see real faces, real struggles, not abstract politics.
    
    **Player choice - public stance**
    
    Michel asks you contribute written epilogue documentary. Your perspective after
    experiencing all sides. Options:
    
    **A: Support Bill 101-Revised**
    "French protection essential. Survival requires vigilance. Strengthened law necessary."
    
    **B: Oppose Bill 101-Revised**
    "Overreach. Bilingualism strength. Balance needed, not domination."
    
    **C: Reform alternative**
    "Support French, but humanize enforcement. Priya's struggle shows need compassion."
    
    **D: Abstain opinion**
    "Not my place decide. Quebecers choose. I document, learn, respect."
    
    Each valid. Shapes documentary's final message.

  epilogue: |
    Bill 101-Revised vote: [Ambiguous - player's world decides]. Either way - debate
    continues. Language identity永恆 tension Quebec.
    
    You? Stay Quebec (if passed test). French improved - functional now, comfortable
    basic conversations. Still accent, still errors, але communicate. Integration
    progressing.
    
    Understand now - language not just words. Identity, history, vulnerability, pride.
    Louise protecting soul people. David defending home. Priya trying belong. All
    legitimate. All human.
    
    Montreal remains bilingual messy beautiful reality. Laws change, але street-level
    negotiation continues. "Bonjour-hi" still greeting. Language choice still statement.
    Learning continues.

    Educational quest. Quebec language politics complex, emotional, legitimate all
    sides. Player experiences personally - French learning real gameplay mechanic,
    test real stakes. Three perspectives respectfully presented - no strawmen.
    Louise not villain, David not oppressor, Priya not victim - all humans navigating
    complicated situation. Bill 101 historical context important. Player can support,
    oppose, reform, або abstain - all valid. Language learning actually affects
    test outcome - choices matter. French phrases taught throughout. Cultural sensitivity
    emphasized. Not propaganda - genuine exploration identity through language.
