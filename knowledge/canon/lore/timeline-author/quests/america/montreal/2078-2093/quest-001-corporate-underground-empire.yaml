      body: |
        Montreal 2078-2093 is a city of extremes - pristine corporate surfaces hide a nightmarish
        underground reality. The 33km network of tunnels serves as both transportation system and
        prison, where corporations extract maximum profit from captive citizens. Underground
        resistance movements fight for the right to surface access and natural light.
