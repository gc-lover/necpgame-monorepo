      body: |
        Montreal 2078-2093 represents the front line of Quebec's cultural survival. Corporations
        market "efficiency implants" that subtly shift language patterns toward English dominance,
        while preserving Quebec's culture as tourist entertainment. Underground networks work to
        protect authentic francophone identity through digital sovereignty initiatives.
