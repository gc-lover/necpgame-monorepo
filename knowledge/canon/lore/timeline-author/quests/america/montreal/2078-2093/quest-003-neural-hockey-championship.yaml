      title: Regional Details
      body: |
        Montreal's hockey culture has been amplified by neural enhancements that allow players
        to predict moves and execute impossible shots. Corporate mega-leagues control the sport
        through betting monopolies, while underground championships in the undercity preserve
        the traditional values of fair play and team spirit.
