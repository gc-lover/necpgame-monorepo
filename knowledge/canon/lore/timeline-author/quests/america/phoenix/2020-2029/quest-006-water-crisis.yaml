summary:
  brief: |
    120°F. Нет воды 3 дня. Rich neighborhoods поливают газоны. Что-то не так.
  
  description: |
    Phoenix, Arizona. Июль 2029. Heat record - 120°F (49°C) пятый день подряд.
    Colorado River practically dry. Lake Mead на историческом minimum. Water crisis
    declared state of emergency.
    
    Но не все страдают equally. North Phoenix, Scottsdale, Paradise Valley - rich
    neighborhoods - имеют воду. Газоны зеленые, бассейны полные, sprinklers работают.
    South Phoenix, working-class Latino neighborhoods - нет воды 3 дня. Люди
    покупают bottled water за crazy цены, elderly умирают от heat stroke.
    
    Maria Gonzales (32), community organizer South Phoenix, знает почему. Phoenix
    Water Department распределяет воду unfairly. Rich areas get priority. Poor areas -
    cutoffs first. Технически "по consumption", реально - классовый discrimination.
    
    Но есть worse secret: AquaTech Solutions, private water corporation, заключила
    deal с городом. Они контролируют half water infrastructure. И they're diverting
    water к paying customers (rich) from public supply (poor). Legal loophole,
    morally monstrous.
    
    Maria нанимает тебя: expose the scheme, force equitable distribution, или
    если нужно - take direct action. People dying. Time running out. Heat unforgiving.

  goal: |
    Investigate water inequality, expose AquaTech corruption, force equitable
    distribution или take matters into own hands.

  essence: |
    Climate dystopia quest. Water scarcity, class inequality, corporate exploitation.
    Cyberpunk noir в пустыне. Moral choices о survival vs law.

story:
  background: |
    Phoenix built в desert. Always dependent на Colorado River water. But climate
    change, 25-year drought, population growth - создали perfect crisis. 2029 -
    breaking point.
    
    City privatized water infrastructure в 2025 "для efficiency". AquaTech Solutions
    получила contracts. They optimized - meaning maximized profit. Rich pay premium
    for guaranteed supply. Poor get what's left - which is nothing.
    
    South Phoenix - преимущественно Latino, working-class. No political power.
    When water cuts started, они первые. North Phoenix - predominantly white, wealthy.
    Lawyers, connections, money. Their water never stopped.

  opening: |
    Community center South Phoenix. Packed. 200 people, angry, scared, desperate.
    Temperatures outside 118°F. No AC (power grid struggling). Inside oven.
    
    Maria на stage: "Three days! Three days no water! My abuela died yesterday.
    Heat stroke. Couldn't cool down. 76 years old. Survived immigrating, worked
    whole life, dies because rich assholes want green lawns!"
    
    Crowd roars. Anger palpable.
    
    Она finds you после meeting: "Thank you for coming. I know you help people.
    We need help. This isn't natural disaster. This is murder. AquaTech killing us.
    City letting them. Somebody needs to stop this."
    
    Shows data: South Phoenix water delivery - 10% normal. North Phoenix - 95%
    normal. "They say 'conservation requirements apply equally'. Bullshit. They
    turn off our lines, keep theirs open. I need proof. Then action. Help me?"

  act_one: |
    **Investigation - gather evidence**
    
    **Step 1: Phoenix Water Department**
    
    Public records request - distribution data. They stonewall: "Proprietary information,
    AquaTech contract confidential." Legal fight takes months.
    
    Alternative: Contact sympathetic insider. Junior engineer David Kim, horrified
    by policy. Secretly provides data: water flow rates per neighborhood. North
    Phoenix getting 10x allocation per capita. "Management says it's consumption
    patterns. But I ran numbers - they're lying. Deliberate redirection."
    
    **Step 2: AquaTech corporate HQ**
    
    Downtown Phoenix, glass tower (irony - monument to water в waterless city).
    CEO office - Jordan Reeves, smooth corporate type.
    
    Request interview (pose as journalist?). Reeves PR-trained: "AquaTech committed
    to serving all Phoenix. Our distribution follows city contracts и conservation
    mandates. Any disparities result from usage patterns, not policy."
    
    Bullshit detector pings. He's lying smoothly.
    
    **Step 3: Hack AquaTech systems**
    
    Need internal communications. Emails, memos, orders. Proof deliberate discrimination.
    
    Infiltrate building (night janitor bribe? Social engineering?) or remote hack
    (difficulty very high). Choose approach.
    
    Success yields goldmine: emails instructing engineers "prioritize Tier 1 customers
    (premium contracts), minimize Tier 3 (public supply)". Internal memo: "PR
    manageable if poor neighborhoods affected - lack media access. Avoid disrupting
    North Phoenix - political connections."
    
    Smoking gun. Now what to do with it?

  act_two: |
    **Choice - how to use evidence**
    
    **Option A: Legal route**
    
    Give evidence to attorney. File lawsuit, contact State Attorney General, media
    exposure. Proper channels.
    
    Pros: Legal, might succeed long-term. Cons: Slow (weeks), people dying now,
    AquaTech lawyers might bury.
    
    **Option B: Media blast**
    
    Send everything to journalists, social media, activists. Viral exposure. Public
    outrage forces immediate action.
    
    Pros: Fast, effective pressure. Cons: Evidence obtained illegally, might not
    hold в court, personal legal risk.
    
    **Option C: Direct action**
    
    Use evidence as leverage, threaten AquaTech: restore equal water distribution
    или everything goes public. Corporate blackmail.
    
    Pros: Immediate results possible. Cons: Illegal, risky, AquaTech might call bluff.
    
    **Option D: Sabotage**
    
    Fuck legal. Hack water systems, manually redistribute flow. Rich neighborhoods
    get cutoffs, South Phoenix gets supply. Robin Hood approach.
    
    Pros: Immediate relief for South Phoenix. Cons: Highly illegal, terrorism charges
    possible, doesn't fix system, temporary solution.
    
    Time pressure: Heat wave continuing. Death toll rising daily. Every day delay =
    more deaths. But hasty action = consequences.
    
    Maria wants D: "People dying now! Lawyers take months! Hack the system! Give
    us water today!" She's desperate, understandable, но is it right?

  act_three: |
    **Crisis and resolution**
    
    Day 5 of heat wave. Temperatures hit 122°F. Another elderly person dies. Hospital
    ER overwhelmed. Community pressure mounting.
    
    Decision time.
    
    **Ending A: Legal victory (slow)**
    
    Chose legal route. Attorney files emergency injunction. Media picks up story.
    State AG investigates. Week later - court orders immediate equitable distribution.
    AquaTech complies (grudgingly). South Phoenix gets water.
    
    But: 12 people died during week wait. Community bitter о delay. Legal victory,
    moral cost. System unchanged long-term - AquaTech still operates, just под monitoring.
    
    **Ending B: Media storm (fast, messy)**
    
    Leaked everything. National news. "Corporate Water Apartheid в Phoenix." Viral
    outrage. Protests. Politicians scramble. AquaTech forced to restore equal supply
    within 48 hours.
    
    But: You arrested - illegal hacking charges. Trial coming. Maria raises defense
    fund. Community calls you hero, law calls you criminal. Grey victory.
    
    **Ending C: Blackmail success (pragmatic)**
    
    Threatened AquaTech: restore supply або public exposure. Reeves calculated - bad
    PR worse than compliance. Quietly orders redistribution. South Phoenix gets water
    next day. No public scandal.
    
    But: No systemic change. AquaTech still controls, just scared. Might retaliate
    later. Temporary fix, deeper problem remains. Pragmatic но incomplete.
    
    **Ending D: Sabotage (radical)**
    
    Hacked water systems. Redirected flow. Rich neighborhoods wake to dry taps.
    South Phoenix has water. Chaos. Media hysteria "Eco-terrorism!" FBI investigation.
    
    But: South Phoenix saved immediately. Community survives heat wave. You wanted
    federal, serious charges if caught. Maria helps hide you. Underground hero.
    
    Long-term: Scandal forces complete water system reform. Public takeover от
    AquaTech. Your crime created systemic change. Revolutionary ending.
    
    Choose your poison. Law, media, blackmail, или revolution. All have costs.
    All save lives. Which cost acceptable?
