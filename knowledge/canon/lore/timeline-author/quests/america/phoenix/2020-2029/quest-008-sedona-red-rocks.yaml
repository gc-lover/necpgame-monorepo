summary:
  brief: |
    Красные скалы. Энергетические вихри. Или продвинутая голограмма? Найди правду.
  
  description: |
    Sedona, Arizona - маленький город среди stunning red rock formations. Знаменит
    двумя вещами: невероятной природой и "energy vortexes" - точками где якобы
    концентрируется spiritual energy. New Age мекка. Тысячи туристов приезжают
    meditate, heal, experience "vibrations".
    
    Cathedral Rock, Bell Rock, Airport Mesa - known vortex sites. Люди клянутся
    они feel something real. Скептики say placebo. Debate длится decades.
    
    Но October 2026 что-то изменилось. Vortex sites начали... glowing. Faint
    красноватый свет ночью. Странные electromagnetic readings. Wildlife avoiding
    areas. И техника сходит с ума near sites - дроны падают, GPS fails, радио
    static.
    
    Dr. Sarah Chen, geologist из University of Arizona, нанимает тебя investigate.
    "Could be natural phenomenon - minerals, magnetism, something geological. Or..."
    она hesitates, "Corporate tech testing. Heard rumors VortexCorp (духовный
    туристический бизнес) installing secret holographic generators для enhance
    vortex experience. Fake mysticism for profit. Need someone confirm which."
    
    Скалолазание, investigation, возможно paranormal phenomena, определенно
    corporate conspiracy. Truth hiding в красных скалах.

  goal: |
    Investigate glowing vortex sites, determine if natural, technological, or
    truly mystical, expose any corporate fraud если существует.

  essence: |
    Quest blending mysticism и technology. Sedona's famous vortexes через cyberpunk
    lens. Lighter mysterious tone с investigation elements. Nature vs exploitation.

story:
  background: |
    Sedona основан в 1902. Red rocks - железо oxide в sandstone, миллионы лет
    geological formation. Stunning beauty привлек artists, затем New Age seekers.
    
    1980s - Page Bryant публиковал book о vortexes. Cathedral Rock, Bell Rock,
    Airport Mesa, Boynton Canyon - identified как vortex sites. Tourism exploded.
    Десятки тысяч visit annually для spiritual experiences.
    
    Science skeptical - no measurable energy differences. Но subjective experiences
    real для многих. Placebo? Geomagnetic anomalies? True spiritual power? Unclear.
    
    VortexCorp - mega tourism company, owns half Sedona businesses. Profit от
    vortex tourism massive. Мотив для enhancement technology obvious.

  opening: |
    Sedona visitor center. Sarah Chen показывает photos: Cathedral Rock ночью,
    faint красноватый glow вокруг вершины. "Started three weeks ago. Thought
    camera malfunction. But множество людей reporting same. And это," она
    показывает readings, "electromagnetic activity spiked 300%. Natural? Impossible.
    Technology? Maybe. But what kind?"
    
    Local spiritual guide, Joshua "Rainbow" Williams, interrupts: "Not technology.
    Vortexes awakening. Earth's energy intensifying. Climate crisis, human consciousness
    shift - energy responding. I feel it. Many feel it. You scientists always
    reduce magic to numbers."
    
    Sarah: "Or VortexCorp installing generators, exploiting beliefs for profit."
    
    Rainbow: "Cynic."
    
    Sarah: "Scientist."
    
    They look at you: "Which side you believe? Go find out. Tonight. Cathedral Rock."

  act_one: |
    **Night investigation - Cathedral Rock**
    
    Hike begins 8 PM. Sedona dark (light pollution minimal). Stars incredible.
    Red rocks looming shadows. Cathedral Rock silhouette против night sky - dramatic.
    
    As approach summit - glow visible. Faint, reddish, pulsing slowly. Beautiful
    и eerie. Rainbow meditating near it, peaceful smile. Sarah scanning with equipment,
    frown deepening.
    
    You observe:
    
    **Subjective experience:** Standing near glow - strange feeling. Tingling?
    Warmth? Peace? Hard to describe. Placebo suggestion или real? Внутренний
    debate.
    
    **Sarah's readings:** "EM field definitely present. Pattern... unusual. Not
    natural geomagnetic. But not standard electronics either. Like... encoded
    somehow. Carrier frequency plus modulation. Technological, probably. But what's
    generating it?"
    
    **Rainbow's testimony:** "Energy pure. No machines. Feel earth pulse. This
    is real spirituality, not corporate fake."
    
    Search for source. Climbing required - glow emanates от top rock formation.
    Difficult climb, dark, dangerous. But necessary.
    
    Summit discovery: Small metallic object embedded в rock crevice. Size basketball,
    matte black, seamless design. Humming faintly. Definitely tech.
    
    Sarah: "There! I knew it! Generator!"
    
    Rainbow, following up: "What... no. Impossible. I felt something real."
    
    Examine device - no markings, no obvious manufacturer. Sophisticated. Military-grade?
    Corporate? Origin unclear. But definitely projecting EM field creating "vortex
    enhancement".

  act_two: |
    **Corporate trail - VortexCorp investigation**
    
    Track device origin. Difficult - no serial numbers, proprietary tech. But
    electromagnetic signature unique. Maybe trace similar devices?
    
    Visit other vortex sites - Bell Rock, Airport Mesa. Each has similar device,
    hidden carefully. Network coordinated. Professional installation.
    
    VortexCorp headquarters - luxury eco-resort. CEO Marcus Vaughn agrees interview.
    Smooth, spiritual-sounding, но corporate eyes.
    
    "Vortexes absolutely real. Our mission - help people experience them fully.
    Yes, we enhance visitor experience. Better trails, guided meditations, comfort
    facilities. Technology? Only для safety - lighting, communications."
    
    Ask directly о devices. He deflects: "Trade secrets, proprietary wellness
    technology, can't discuss details."
    
    Translation: He's behind it.
    
    **Hacking VortexCorp:** Breaking into their systems (digital или physical).
    Dangerous но informative.
    
    Success reveals: Project "Harmonic Amplification" - install EM generators at
    vortex sites, create measurable effects. Tourists feel "real" energy, more
    satisfied, reviews better, business booms. Cost: $2M. ROI: $50M projected over
    5 years. Pure profit scheme.
    
    Internal email: "Doesn't matter if vortexes real originally. Ours definitely
    real now (technologically). Customer satisfaction up 85%. Nobody questions
    source. Perfect."
    
    Smoking gun. But...

  act_three: |
    **Moral dilemma - what to do with truth?**
    
    Evidence clear: VortexCorp faking vortex enhancements for profit. Exploiting
    beliefs. Fraud, essentially.
    
    But complications:
    
    **1. People genuinely benefiting:** Tourists feeling healed, peaceful, better.
    Placebo or tech-induced, но results real for them. Exposing fraud = destroying
    their experience, belief, healing. Cruel?
    
    **2. Local economy:** Sedona depends на vortex tourism. VortexCorp employs
    500 locals. Scandal = tourism crash, jobs lost, town economy damaged. Greater
    good?
    
    **3. Rainbow's belief:** He felt something real. Before tech, after tech,
    doesn't matter - experience changed his life. Taking that away = what?
    
    **4. Science vs spirituality:** Maybe vortexes never "real" scientifically.
    Maybe belief creates reality. Complicated philosophy.
    
    **Choice:**
    
    **A. Public exposure:** Release everything. Media, social networks, government.
    VortexCorp scandal, CEO arrested, devices removed. Truth wins. But tourism
    crashes, jobs lost, beliefs shattered. Pyrrhic victory.
    
    **B. Blackmail VortexCorp:** Private threat - remove devices, return to natural
    state, или public exposure. They comply (grudgingly). Vortexes "return" to
    original mystery. But did you just help corporate cover-up?
    
    **C. Leave it:** Walk away. People happy, economy good, beliefs intact. Fraud
    continues, но victimless (arguably). Pragmatic moral compromise. Can you live
    with it?
    
    **D. Transform it:** Expose fraud BUT reframe - "VortexCorp enhanced what was
    always potential. Technology meets spirituality. Sedona's vortexes now scientifically
    proven!" Spin scandal into innovation story. Everyone wins, truth flexible.
    Most cynical, possibly smartest.
    
    Sarah wants A. Rainbow would prefer C (если he knew). Local business owners
    probably want D. What do YOU want?

  resolution: |
    **If exposed:** Scandal huge. CEO resigns, devices removed, refunds issued,
    lawsuits filed. Sedona tourism drops 60%. Recovery takes years. Truth costly.
    Sarah vindicated. Rainbow disillusioned.
    
    **If blackmailed:** Devices quietly removed over months. VortexCorp survives,
    chastened. Sedona returns to mysterious status quo. Nobody wiser except you.
    Pragmatic win.
    
    **If left alone:** You walk away. Burden of knowledge yours alone. Sedona thrives,
    people happy, fraud continues. Guilt gnaws, но life goes on. Compromise accepted.
    
    **If transformed:** Brilliant PR spin. "Sedona pioneers spiritual-technological
    fusion!" Media loves it. Tourism increases. VortexCorp becomes legit tech-wellness
    company. Truth weaponized для profit, но honestly this time. Cynical genius.
    
    Bonus discovery: Examining devices closely reveals... organic components.
    Biological circuits. Not fully technological. Hybrid technology-nature interface.
    Maybe Rainbow partially right? Maybe vortexes real, tech just amplifying existing
    energy? Question lingers. Mystery preserved.
    
    Sedona's red rocks keep secrets. You learned one. What you do with it = who you are.
