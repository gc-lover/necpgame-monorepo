story:
  background: |
    Cactus League - Arizona spring training - tradition с 1947. 15 MLB teams, 10
    stadiums, Phoenix metro area. February-March every year. Tourists flock,
    economy booms, dreams born.
    
    Tommy Chen - Chinese-American, grew up Phoenix. Baseball prodigy в high school.
    Drafted minor leagues 2005, age 18. 18 years climbing ladder - AAA closest он
    got. 2023 arm injury ended career. Bitter но accepting. At least Kevin has chance.
    
    Kevin Chen - inherited talent без baggage. Fastball 95 mph at 16. Scouts noticed
    freshman year. Could be first-round draft pick 2027. But Coach Rodriguez -
    gambling debts to local bookies. Taking payoffs для fix youth games, sabotage
    prospects. Kevin unknowing victim.

  opening: |
    Saturday night, 11 PM. Tommy calls desperate: "Please. I know we haven't talked
    since... but Kevin needs help. Showcase tomorrow, и something wrong with his
    pitching. Can't figure it. Please come. Salt River Fields, midnight. Please."
    
    Arrive at empty stadium. Security lets you через - Tommy's friend. Lights
    dimmed, field quiet. Tommy и Kevin on mound. Kevin (16, tall, nervous) throwing
    to Tommy catching. Each pitch wild, inconsistent. Frustration visible.
    
    Tommy: "See? Mechanics fell apart last month. Coach Rodriguez changed his delivery,
    said 'optimize power'. Now он overthrowing, losing control. Showcase tomorrow -
    если throws like this, scouts pass. Career over before started. I can't fix it.
    Twenty years I pitched, но I can't help my own son."
    
    Voice cracks. Failure haunting him.
    
    Kevin: "Dad, it's okay. Coach says it's normal adjustment period."
    
    Tommy: "Your coach doesn't know shit!" Rare anger. "Something wrong. I feel it.
    But I..." He looks at you. "Can you watch? Analyze? You understand mechanics, right?"
    
    Kevin throws again. You observe:
    
    Hip rotation off. Front foot landing wrong. Arm slot changed - strain visible.
    Release point inconsistent. These aren't optimizations - these are sabotage.
    Coach deliberately taught wrong mechanics. Why?

  act_one: |
    **Investigation - why sabotage?**
    
    Question Kevin: "Coach Rodriguez seemed weird last month. Stressed. Angry.
    Changed my whole delivery, said old way 'limited potential'. Dad didn't agree
    но Coach insisted."
    
    Tommy: "Rodriguez coaching 10 years. Good record. Why suddenly change Kevin?
    Unless..." Dark thought forms. "Unless he wants Kevin to fail."
    
    Research Rodriguez. Social media, records, connections. Discovery: Rodrig

uez
    photographed at illegal betting parlor. Debts rumored. Cross-reference youth
    baseball games - several key players Rodriguez coached failed unexpectedly в
    critical moments. Pattern.
    
    Gambling syndicate fixing youth games для profit. Rodriguez in их pocket.
    Kevin's showcase - heavily bet. Rodriguez sabotaged mechanics so Kevin fails,
    bets pay off. Cruel, systematic exploitation.
    
    **Proof needed:** Record Rodriguez admitting conspiracy или catch him at parlor
    arranging fix. But time limited - showcase 10 hours away. Priority: fix Kevin first,
    justice second. Or handle both?

  act_two: |
    **Training montage - fix mechanics**
    
    Midnight to 6 AM. You, Tommy, Kevin. Empty field, desert stars, determination.
    
    **Step 1: Diagnose** - Identify every wrong change Rodriguez made. Hip turn
    35 degrees off. Foot landing heel-first instead toe. Arm slot raised causing
    shoulder strain. Release point moved forward - losing deception.
    
    **Step 2: Rebuild** - Return to Kevin's natural mechanics. Tommy demonstrates
    (old arm creaks but muscle memory intact). You analyze, adjust, perfect. Kevin
    struggles - месяц bad habits hard to break.
    
    **Step 3: Confidence** - Mental game crucial. Kevin doubt creeping. "What if
    scouts already decided? What if I'm not good enough?"
    
    Tommy: "You're good enough. I never was, но you are. Trust your gift. Trust
    your father. Trust yourself."
    
    Beautiful father-son moment. Kevin nods. Throws again. Better. Again. Better.
    Again. Perfect. Fastball hits catcher's mitt - CRACK. 96 mph. Natural, effortless,
    powerful.
    
    Kevin grins. Tommy cries. You nod.
    
    But 6 AM - Coach Rodriguez arrives early. Sees you training. Furious.
    
    "What the hell? Tommy, you changing Kevin's mechanics night before showcase?
    Are you insane? Kevin, ignore everything они said. Use my system!"
    
    Confrontation inevitable.

  act_three: |
    **Showdown - expose corruption или let it slide**
    
    **Choice A: Confront Rodriguez directly**
    
    Accuse him gambling conspiracy. He denies, threatens lawsuit, tries intimidate
    Kevin back to broken mechanics. Kevin confused, scared. Tommy stands firm: "My
    son, my decision. He pitches natural way."
    
    Rodriguez storms off: "You'll regret this. All of you." Ominous.
    
    Showcase proceeds. Kevin pitches beautifully - natural mechanics restored. Scouts
    impressed. 7 teams approach после. Future secure.
    
    But Rodriguez retaliates - files complaint против Tommy for "unauthorized coaching",
    tries ban him от stadium. Legal battle begins. Victory costly.
    
    **Choice B: Anonymous tip to league officials**
    
    Before showcase, send evidence to MLB officials и Arizona Gaming Control Board.
    Investigation starts quietly. Rodriguez unaware, attends showcase normally.
    
    Kevin pitches perfectly. Scouts love him. Rodriguez forced smile, seething inside.
    
    Next week - Rodriguez arrested. Gambling conspiracy exposed. Multiple coaches,
    players, bookies implicated. Kevin vindicated, Tommy cleared, justice served.
    Clean victory.
    
    **Choice C: Let Rodriguez win**
    
    Too risky expose conspiracy. Use Kevin pitch natural mechanics despite Rodriguez.
    "Coach's advice didn't work для me, trying old way." Diplomatic.
    
    Rodriguez suspicious but can't stop Kevin. Showcase proceeds. Kevin dominates.
    Scouts sign him. Rodriguez takes credit publicly. Tommy silent, bitter, но Kevin
    safe.
    
    Justice delayed, но son's future secured. Pragmatic choice.
    
    **Choice D: Tommy pitches**
    
    Wildcard. Tommy challenges Rodriguez to prove his system works: "You pitch
    one inning using your mechanics. If scouts impressed, Kevin follows. If not,
    Kevin pitches natural."
    
    Rodriguez trapped - can't pitch himself. Backs down. Humiliated publicly. Kevin
    pitches natural way, succeeds. Rodriguez credibility destroyed without exposing
    gambling (yet). Creative solution.
    
    **Epilogue:**
    
    Kevin drafted first round 2027. Signs $2M bonus. Buys parents house. Tommy works
    Kevin's games как equipment manager - stays close to baseball. Dream partially
    redeemed.
    
    Spring training continues. Desert sun, crack of bat, smell grass. Some dreams
    deferred, others begin. Baseball eternal.
