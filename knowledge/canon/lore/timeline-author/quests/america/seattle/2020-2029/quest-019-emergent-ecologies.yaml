summary:
  problem: Seattle's urban ecology evolves through bioengineered interventions creating hybrid ecosystems.
  goal: Study and manage emergent ecological systems in Seattle's engineered urban environments.
  essence: Navigate bioengineered forests, artificial wetlands, and hybrid species in Seattle's evolving ecosystem.
  key_points:
    - Bioengineered plants and animals adapt to urban environments.
    - Hybrid ecosystems emerge from human intervention.
    - Indigenous species preservation conflicts with engineered solutions.
    - Climate change accelerates ecological transformation.

      title: Description
      body: |
        Seattle's urban landscape has become a laboratory for bioengineering innovation. Engineered plants
        climb abandoned skyscrapers, artificial wetlands filter pollutants, and hybrid species adapt to
        the city's changing climate. Players must navigate this complex ecological transformation.

      title: Regional Details
      body: |
        Seattle's rainy climate and dense urban environment create ideal conditions for rapid ecological
        experimentation. Bioengineered solutions address pollution, food security, and climate adaptation,
        but create complex ethical and ecological challenges.
