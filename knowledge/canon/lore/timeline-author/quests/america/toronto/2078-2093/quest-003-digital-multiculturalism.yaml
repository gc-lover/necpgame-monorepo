      body: |
        Toronto's multicultural districts have become battlegrounds for digital sovereignty.
        Corporations scan and digitize cultural artifacts, traditions, and languages for profit,
        leaving communities without access to their own heritage. Underground networks work
        to preserve and protect digital cultural identity.
