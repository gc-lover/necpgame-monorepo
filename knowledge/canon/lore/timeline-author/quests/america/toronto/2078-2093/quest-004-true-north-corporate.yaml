      body: |
        As Canada's largest city, Toronto is ground zero for corporate appropriation of Canadian
        identity. The maple leaf has become a corporate logo, hockey is marketed as extreme
        entertainment, and traditional Canadian values are commodified for global consumption.
        Underground movements work to preserve authentic Canadian culture.
