      title: Regional Details
      body: |
        Toronto's healthcare system epitomizes corporate greed in the cyberpunk world. Advanced
        medical technology is available only to the wealthy, while lower-income citizens suffer
        from treatable conditions. Underground clinics operate in secret, providing basic care
        and fighting against the medical establishment.
