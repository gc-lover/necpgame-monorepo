        Tokyo's legendary theater district has been transformed into a neural-linked entertainment
        complex where corporate algorithms control every performance. Traditional kabuki and
        contemporary theater have merged with virtual reality, but artistic expression is dictated
        by profit-maximizing algorithms. Players must navigate this digital theater landscape to
        restore creative freedom and establish independent digital artistry.

        Tokyo 2030-2039 marks the complete digital transformation of entertainment. Theater
        districts like Shinjuku and Shibuya have become neural performance hubs where audiences
        experience performances through direct neural links. Corporate control over artistic
        expression has reached its peak, but underground digital collectives fight to preserve
        authentic creativity in the face of algorithmic standardization.
