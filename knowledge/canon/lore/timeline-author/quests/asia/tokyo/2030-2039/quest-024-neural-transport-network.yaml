      body: |
        Tokyo's transportation infrastructure has evolved into a neural-linked network where
        corporate algorithms control every movement. Citizens must interface with neural systems
        to access trains, buses, and personal vehicles, while corporations track and monetize
        every journey. Players must navigate this controlled transport landscape to establish
        autonomous mobility and free citizens from corporate surveillance.

      title: Regional Details
      body: |
        Tokyo 2030-2039 transportation represents the complete neural integration of mobility.
        Every form of transport requires neural authentication and is subject to corporate
        algorithms that optimize for profit rather than efficiency. Underground hackers have
        created alternative transport networks, but corporate countermeasures constantly
        threaten these autonomous routes.

        Quest combines neural interface puzzles with real-time routing challenges. Player
        must navigate Tokyo's transport network while managing neural link stability,
        hacking corporate algorithms on the move, coordinating with underground transport
        operators, and establishing autonomous zones that resist corporate takeover.
