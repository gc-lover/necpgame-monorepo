        Japan's imperial throne has been transformed into a digital entity controlled by
        corporate algorithms, where the emperor exists as a neural-linked figurehead
        manipulated by megacorporations. Traditional imperial authority has been commodified
        and digitized, serving corporate interests rather than the Japanese people. Players
        must infiltrate the digital imperial palace to expose this manipulation and restore
        authentic leadership to Japan's highest office.

        Tokyo 2030-2039 marks the complete corporate takeover of Japan's traditional
        institutions. The imperial palace in Tokyo has been digitized, with the emperor
        existing as a neural entity whose thoughts and decisions are influenced by
        corporate algorithms. Traditional ceremonies have been turned into commercial
        spectacles, while underground traditionalists work to preserve authentic imperial
        authority.
