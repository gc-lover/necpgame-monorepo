      body: |
        Tokyo 2040-2060 has become a hybrid city where physical decay coexists with digital
        transcendence. Massive data centers house virtual worlds more real than physical
        reality, while consciousness upload facilities offer escape from climate-ravaged
        existence. The line between physical and digital has blurred completely, forcing
        humanity to choose its evolutionary path.
