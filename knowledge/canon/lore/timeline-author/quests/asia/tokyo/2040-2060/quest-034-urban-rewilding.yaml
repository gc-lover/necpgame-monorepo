summary:
  problem: As climate change devastates Tokyo, bioengineers work to rewild abandoned urban spaces, creating hybrid ecosystems.
  goal: Navigate Tokyo's urban rewilding projects and help establish sustainable coexistence between nature and technology.
  essence: Player explores Tokyo's reclaimed urban wilderness while confronting the ethics of bioengineered nature.
  key_points:
    - Abandoned districts reclaimed by engineered ecosystems.
    - Bioengineered plants and animals adapting to urban environments.
    - Corporate control over ecological restoration projects.
    - Indigenous species preservation vs. engineered solutions.
    - Balance between human habitation and natural reclamation.

      body: |
        As climate catastrophe forces Tokyo's evacuation, nature begins reclaiming abandoned
        urban spaces through both natural processes and bioengineering. Vast districts have
        become hybrid ecosystems where engineered plants and animals coexist with returning
        indigenous species. Players must navigate this urban wilderness, mediating between
        human needs and ecological restoration while confronting corporate control over
        bioengineered nature.

      body: |
        Tokyo 2040-2060 represents the paradox of urban rewilding, where climate-induced
        abandonment creates opportunities for ecological restoration. Bioengineered forests
        grow in abandoned skyscrapers, while indigenous species return to reclaimed wetlands.
        Corporate interests attempt to control this natural renaissance for profit, while
        environmentalists fight for authentic ecological restoration.

        Quest combines ecological exploration with bioengineering simulation. Player
        navigates hybrid urban ecosystems, manages wildlife populations, confronts
        bioengineered anomalies, establishes conservation protocols, and balances
        human habitation needs with ecological restoration goals.
