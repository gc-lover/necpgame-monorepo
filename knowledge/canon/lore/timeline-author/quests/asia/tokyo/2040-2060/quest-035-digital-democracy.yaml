      body: |
        As traditional governance systems collapse under the weight of Tokyo's crises,
        the city has embraced radical digital democracy where every decision is subject
        to instant citizen voting. Algorithms optimize democratic processes for efficiency,
        but corporate influence threatens the authenticity of this new democratic experiment.
        Players must navigate Tokyo's digital democracy, exposing manipulation while
        preserving democratic ideals in the algorithmic age.

      body: |
        Tokyo 2040-2060 represents the extreme of democratic experimentation, where every
        aspect of city governance is subject to instant citizen voting. Massive data centers
        process billions of votes daily, while algorithms optimize democratic processes for
        maximum efficiency. However, corporate interests have infiltrated these systems,
        manipulating outcomes to serve private agendas over public good.

      body: |
        Quest combines voting simulation with algorithmic investigation mechanics. Player
        participates in digital democracy, analyzes voting algorithms, exposes information
        manipulation, organizes citizen oversight, and reforms democratic systems while
        managing the tension between efficiency and authentic participation.
