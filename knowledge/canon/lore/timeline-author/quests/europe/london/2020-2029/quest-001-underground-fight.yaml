      title: The Underground Scene
      body: |
        In the aftermath of Brexit and the 2020s economic crash, London's underground has become a battleground for the desperate.
        Abandoned Tube tunnels and forgotten Victorian sewers now host brutal fight clubs where the unemployed and disenfranchised
        fight for pride, money, and sometimes just to feel alive in a city that's forgotten them.

      title: Moral Choices
      body: |
        **Fight or Flight**: Help a defeated opponent escape rather than finish them off?

        **Betrayal**: Report the club's illegal operations to authorities or stay loyal to the underground code?

        **Mercy**: Spare a corporate spy who infiltrated the club, or make an example of them?

        **Championship**: Accept a fixed fight for extra money or fight clean for honor?

      title: London 2020s Context
      body: |
        The underground fights reflect the growing divide between London's haves and have-nots.
        While corporate executives enjoy cyber-enhanced luxuries above ground, the working class battles
        in the darkness below, their fights broadcast illegally on the dark web for betting syndicates.
