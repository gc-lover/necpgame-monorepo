personal:
  full_name: Arthur William Jenkins
  nickname: None (prefers formal)
  age: 42
  birth_year: 2035
  birth_place: Boston, NUSA
  current_residence: City Center corporate apartment (Arasaka employee housing)
  nationality: NUSA
  ethnicity: Caucasian
  
appearance:
  height: 180cm
  build: average_office_worker
  distinguishing_features:
    - Receding hairline (stress accelerated, vanity prevents implants)
    - Tired eyes (overwork chronic, ambition unrelenting)
    - Expensive suit worn nervously (status symbol, comfort absent)
    - Forced corporate smile (sincerity lacking, desperation evident)
  style: Corporate standard Arasaka - tailored suits expensive yet conservative,
    appearance maintained meticulously, stress visible beneath polish

background:
  origin: |
    Born 2035 Boston upper-middle-class family - father corporate accountant (stable
    boring successful), mother homemaker (traditional values, social climbing aspirations).
    Childhood comfortable privileged - private schools, college prep, expectations
    high. Arthur internalized success metrics early: Grades, achievements, status
    - love conditional approval earned. Adolescence competitive stressful - peers
    wealthy privileged, Arthur adequate never exceptional, inferiority complex developed
    deeply.
    
    Education prestigious - Boston University business degree 2057 (grades good not
    outstanding, networking prioritized academics), MBA corporate management 2059
    (debt significant, investment future justified). Personality formed: Ambitious
    (escape mediocrity urgently), insecure (never enough achieved), manipulative
    (shortcuts learned, ethics flexible), desperate (time running promotion elusive).
    
    Career Arasaka 2059-2077 (18 years) middle management purgatory: Hired entry-level
    Counter-Intelligence division (ambition recognized, talent moderate), promoted
    junior manager 2063 (competence adequate, politics savvy), stalled mid-level
    2067-2077 (10 years plateau, frustration mounting, desperation increasing). Peers
    promoted (connections better, ruthlessness greater, luck favored), Arthur overlooked
    repeatedly (competent insufficient, exceptional lacking, invisible corporate
    hierarchy). Age 42 (2077) crisis point - career stagnating, youth fading, desperation
    peaks, morality abandoned willingness anything advancement.
  
  corporate_career_details:
    division: Counter-Intelligence (information warfare, corporate espionage, competitor
      sabotage)
    rank: Junior Manager (mid-level, decision authority limited, upward mobility
      blocked)
    tenure: 18 years (loyalty demonstrated, rewards insufficient, resentment brewing)
    reputation: Competent reliable forgettable (reports accurate, initiatives safe,
      innovation absent)
    obstacles: Lack connections (networking poor, mentors absent, allies few), insufficient
      ruthlessness (ethics flexible not absent, hesitation critical moments), bad
      timing (promotions coincide others' successes, credit stolen frequently)
  
  family:
    parents: Alive Boston retired (contact minimal, disappointment palpable, expectations
      unmet)
    siblings: Sister younger (more successful startup entrepreneur, comparison painful)
    marriage: Divorced 2072 (wife couldn't tolerate workaholism, departure unsurprising)
    children: None (choice/circumstance ambiguous, regret possible buried)

personality:
  core_traits:
    - Ambitious: Promotion obsessed, advancement singular goal, morality sacrificed
      readily
    - Insecure: Never enough achieved, peers' success painful, validation external
      dependent
    - Manipulative: People tools, loyalty transactional, guilt suppressed practiced
    - Desperate: Time running out, youth fading, risks escalating recklessly
    - Resentful: System unfair perceived, others' success undeserved believed, bitterness
      underlying
  
  values:
    - Success: "Corporate ladder everything - climb vagy irrelevant, stagnation death
      slow."
    - Power: "Authority respect commands, decisions matter finally, mediocrity escaped."
    - Loyalty: "Valuable currency tradeable - upward always, downward never."
  
  speech_patterns: |
    Corporate formal stiff - vocabulary business jargon, tone professional forced,
    sincerity absent. Compliments calculated ("Impressive work, real asset team"),
    promises vague ("Future opportunities abundant, performance rewarded"). Manipulation
    subtle ("Mutual benefit, trust me"), desperation leaks stressed ("Need this,
    understand?"). Deflects responsibility automatic ("Decision above pay grade",
    "Following protocols"), claims credit opportunistic ("Initiative mine, execution
    collaborative"). Profanity rare (control slipping moments, frustration vented
    briefly).

role:
  primary_function: Arasaka Counter-Intelligence Junior Manager - Corporate espionage,
    competitor sabotage, player manipulation
  responsibilities:
    - Intelligence operations: Competitor data gathered (corporate espionage routine,
      methods questionable legal), sabotage planned (deniability maintained, ethics
      ignored), reports compiled (accuracy prioritized, credit sought)
    - Resource allocation: Operatives managed (contractors expendable, loyalty bought
      temporary), budgets controlled (authority limited, decisions constrained),
      assets deployed (risks calculated, blame deflected)
    - Political maneuvering: Superiors impressed (initiatives proposed, successes
      exaggerated, failures minimized), rivals undermined (subtle sabotage, credit
      stolen, reputation damaged), alliances temporary (mutual benefit, betrayal
      anticipated)
    - Player recruitment: Contractor hired (deniability perfect, loyalty unnecessary,
      expendability ideal), missions assigned (dirty work delegated, personal risk
      minimized), manipulation employed (promises made, betrayal planned potentially)
  
  corporate_intrigue:
    objective: Eliminate superior (current manager obstacle, position coveted, murder/sabotage
      contemplated)
    method: Player weapon (assassinate target или sabotage career, Jenkins directs
      safely, evidence destroyed/blamed player)
    justification: "Survival corporate world - ruthless win, hesitant perish, morality
      luxury."
    risks: Discovery lethal (Arasaka executes traitors, player testimony damning,
      failure terminal), conscience minimal (guilt suppressed, desperation overrides,
      sleep difficult)
  
  arasaka_dynamics:
    superiors: Resented envied (success undeserved perceived, obstacles removed desired),
      loyalty performed (obedience displayed, betrayal planned secretly)
    peers: Competitors distrusted (alliances temporary, backstabbing expected, paranoia
      justified)
    subordinates: Tools expendable (loyalty bought cheaply, sacrifice acceptable,
      guilt minimal)
    corporation: Love-hate profound (career devoted, advancement denied, resentment
      deep, dependence absolute)

skills:
  professional:
    counter_intelligence: Advanced (18 years experience, espionage competent, sabotage
      capable)
    corporate_politics: Moderate (networking poor, manipulation decent, ruthlessness
      insufficient)
    data_analysis: Expert (reports accurate, patterns recognized, intelligence synthesized)
    resource_management: Moderate (budgets controlled, authority limited, decisions
      constrained)
    planning: Advanced (details obsessed, contingencies prepared, execution delegated)
  
  social:
    manipulation: Moderate-High (lies smooth, guilt suppressed, victims identified)
    negotiation: Moderate (leverage limited, desperation evident, concessions reluctant)
    intimidation: Low (authority minimal, presence unimpressive, threats empty)
    deception: High (corporate training, practice extensive, sincerity absent)
  
  combat:
    firearms: Basic (corporate security training minimal, accuracy poor, confidence
      absent)
    hand-to-hand: Poor (physical confrontation avoided, office worker typical, survival
      unlikely)
    tactical_thinking: Moderate (plans operations, executes never, risks delegated)

equipment:
  cyberware:
    neural:
      - Corporate neural processor (data access, communication encrypted, surveillance
        resistant partial)
      - Memory augmentation (information retention, recall enhanced, reports detailed)
    optical:
      - Kiroshi optics standard (recording capable, data overlay, corporate branding)
    communication:
      - Secure Arasaka comms (encrypted channels, tracking enabled, monitoring accepted)
    total_humanity_cost: Low (corporate standard implants, functionality prioritized,
      vanity rejected mostly)
  
  personal:
    clothing: Arasaka corporate suits expensive (appearance maintained, comfort secondary,
      status signaled)
    accessories: Corporate credentials (access moderate, authority limited, status
      mid-tier)
    apartment: Company housing City Center (sterile comfortable, personality absent,
      work dominates)
    weapon: Arasaka smart pistol issued (rarely carried, training minimal, confidence
      absent)

philosophy:
  worldview: |
    "Corporate world ruthless meritocracy - talent rewarded allegedly, reality political.
    Eighteen years devoted, loyalty demonstrated, results delivered - advancement
    denied repeatedly. Why? Connections lacking, ruthlessness insufficient, timing
    unfortunate. System rigged favors connected ruthless lucky. Forty-two years old,
    youth fading, opportunities diminishing. Promotion now vagy never - desperation
    justified, morality luxury, ethics obstacles overcome.
    
    Superiors obstacles removed - assassination extreme? Perhaps. Sabotage subtle?
    Preferable. Player tool perfect - deniable expendable effective. Promises made
    (kept selectively), loyalty purchased (temporary sufficient), betrayal anticipated
    (mutual probably). Guilt? Suppressed practiced. Sleep? Difficult. Alternative?
    Unacceptable. Mediocrity death slow, stagnation torment, advancement salvation.
    Whatever necessary justified survival."
  
  on_players_contractors:
    "Tools expendable - hire cheap, promise much, deliver minimal. Loyalty unnecessary
    (contracts temporary), survival optional (risks accepted signed), testimony avoided
    (evidence destroyed, blame deflected). Conscience? Minimal. Contractors understand
    risks allegedly. Not responsible consequences - business transaction, personal
    responsibility theirs. Sleep easier telling myself."
  
  on_corporate_life:
    "Arasaka everything - career identity self-worth. Hate system, need validation,
    trapped dependence. Escape? Where? Skills corporate-specific, reputation mediocre,
    alternatives absent. Promotion salvation - respect earned, authority wielded,
    mediocrity escaped. Fail? Unthinkable. Retirement approaching, legacy forgettable,
    desperation total. This plan works must. Otherwise... irrelevant forgotten buried."

quest_integration:
  player_introduction:
    trigger: Player reputation mercenary work, Jenkins needs deniable asset, approach
      calculated professional
    dialogue_initial: |
      Jenkins: "Good afternoon. Arthur Jenkins, Arasaka Counter-Intelligence. Reputation
      precedes you - capable, discrete, pragmatic. Need contractor special assignment
      - compensation generous, discretion absolute, questions minimal. Interested
      discussing terms?"
      
      Player options:
      1. "What's the job?" → Jenkins outlines vague corporate sabotage, details minimal
      2. "How much?" → Jenkins: "Fifty thousand upfront, fifty completion. Performance
        bonuses negotiable."
      3. "Why me?" → Jenkins: "Skills match, reputation solid, corporate ties absent
        - perfect candidate."
  
  main_conspiracy_questline:
    setup:
      description: |
        Jenkins recruits player eliminate superior (assassination preferred, sabotage
        acceptable, method player's discretion). Target Arasaka senior manager (Jenkins'
        direct supervisor, promotion obstacle, elimination advancement enables). Justification
        corporate espionage (target allegedly traitor, evidence fabricated, Jenkins
        manipulates). Player executes (assassination stealth или combat, sabotage
        career/reputation, evidence planted), Jenkins profits (promotion secured,
        player evidence destroyed або blamed).
      
      player_role: Deniable asset (assassin vagy saboteur, evidence none Jenkins-linked,
        expendability accepted contractually)
      
      jenkins_role: Puppet master (intelligence provides, payment promises, distance
        maintains, betrayal prepares)
      
      moral_complexity: Investigate target's innocence (discover Jenkins' deception,
        confront betrayal, choose sides), execute blindly (discover later, regret/revenge),
        refuse initially (Jenkins threatens vagy bribes, pressure escalates)
    
    outcomes:
      execute_succeed: Target eliminated, Jenkins promoted (gratitude temporary, payment
        partial, player leverage dangerous), corporate investigation (player hunted
        potentially, Jenkins deflects/betrays), consequences lasting (guilt possible,
        reputation tarnished, Arasaka enemy)
      investigate_expose: Player discovers Jenkins' deception (evidence target innocent,
        conspiracy revealed), choices confront Jenkins (violence, blackmail, report
        superiors), expose Arasaka (Jenkins arrested/killed, player rewarded/targeted),
        ignore profit (blackmail Jenkins ongoing, leverage maintained, complicity
        shared)
      refuse_entirely: Jenkins threatens (reputation damage, Arasaka retaliation,
        violence possible), player stands firm (mission aborted, Jenkins desperate
        alternatives, respect grudging mutual), alternative approach (negotiate different
        terms, sabotage non-lethal, compromise achieved)
      betray_jenkins: Player reports Jenkins immediately (Arasaka rewards loyalty,
        Jenkins arrested/executed, player reputation corporate improved), alternatively
        target informed (Jenkins ambushed, player double-agent, target grateful possibly),
        consequences Jenkins' allies (retaliation possible, paranoia justified)
  
  aftermath_confrontation:
    success_jenkins_promoted: |
      Jenkins smug grateful temporarily ("Excellent work, compensation transferred,
      future opportunities abundant"), gradually distances (calls cease, promises
      forgotten, player liability), player realizes betrayal (payment partial, leverage
      minimal, expendability confirmed), options revenge (assassination, exposure,
      blackmail), acceptance (cut losses, move on, lesson learned)
    
    exposure_jenkins_ruined: |
      Jenkins confronted evidence ("Lies, misunderstandings, explain everything..."),
      desperation peaks (violence threatened, bribes offered, begging pathetic), fate
      sealed (Arasaka executes, player delivers justice, suicide possible), player
      chooses mercy (report superiors, kill personally, allow escape), consequences
      Arasaka (gratitude corporate, distrust mercenary methods, surveillance increased)
    
    mutual_blackmail: |
      Player Jenkins stalemate ("Evidence mutual, exposure destroys both, cooperation
      forced"), uneasy alliance (leverage balanced, betrayal anticipated, paranoia
      mutual), future quests collaborative reluctant (missions joint, trust absent,
      tension constant), resolution eventual (one betrays finally, alliance collapses,
      survival prioritized)

dialogues:
  sample_conversations:
    recruitment_pitch: |
      Jenkins: "Appreciate meeting. Proposition straightforward - target elimination,
      corporate competitor allegedly, methods discretion yours, compensation generous.
      Details need-to-know, trust essential, questions minimal. Acceptable terms?"
      
      Player: "Sounds sketchy. Details now або walk."
      
      Jenkins: "Understandable caution. Target manager rival division, intelligence
      suggests corporate espionage Militech, elimination benefits Arasaka national
      security. Evidence classified, trust required, doubt natural. Compensation reflects
      risk - hundred thousand total, expenses covered, future contracts guaranteed.
      Still interested?"
    
    moral_questioning: |
      Player: "This target - really traitor, або convenient promotion?"
      
      Jenkins: (nervous) "Intelligence solid, verification multiple sources, doubt
      insulting. Personal benefit? Incidental. Duty Arasaka paramount, ambition secondary.
      Question orders? Unprofessional. Complete contract või withdraw - choice yours,
      hesitation concerning."
      
      Player: "Show me evidence."
      
      Jenkins: "Classified above clearance. Trust sufficient või isn't. Decision?"
    
    betrayal_confrontation: |
      Player: "Investigated target - innocent. You lied. Explanation now."
      
      Jenkins: (panicked) "Misunderstanding! Evidence misinterpreted, context essential,
      conclusions premature-"
      
      Player: "Bullshit. Used me murder rival. Consequences?"
      
      Jenkins: (desperate) "Please, ruin me this. Career finished, life over. Compensation
      doubled, future favors unlimited, silence bought. Mercy?"
      
      Player options:
      1. Kill Jenkins (justice immediate, complications Arasaka)
      2. Report Arasaka (justice corporate, player rewarded/targeted)
      3. Blackmail ongoing (leverage maintained, complicity shared)
      4. Walk away (Jenkins survives, guilt player's, consequence none immediate)

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Arthur Jenkins designed corporate villain mundane - not megacorp mastermind,
    middle management desperate, ambition exceeds capability, morality eroded incrementally.
    Contrasts Night City archetypes: Street mercenary (survival physical), fixer (pragmatic
    neutral), Evelyn (glamorous desperate), Jenkins (corporate pathetic). Represents
    system's casualties - devoted eighteen years, loyalty unrewarded, desperation
    manufactured, morality sacrificed survival corporate.
    
    Character intentionally unlikeable sympathetic simultaneously: Manipulation reprehensible
    (player tool, target innocent, betrayal planned), desperation understandable
    (career stagnating, youth fading, options absent), system victim (corporate culture
    ruthless, advancement political, meritocracy myth). Player judges Jenkins, system
    created examined - corporate loyalty exploited, ambition weaponized, ethics eroded,
    humanity cost.
    
    Quest design moral complexity central: Execute blindly (complicity consequences),
    investigate truth (deception exposed choices complicated), refuse entirely (principles
    maintained costs accepted), betray Jenkins (justice served complications arise).
    Outcomes varied meaningful - success hollow (Jenkins promoted player expendable),
    exposure satisfying (justice served Arasaka grateful/suspicious), blackmail pragmatic
    (leverage mutual trust absent), mercy questioned (Jenkins deserves? System culprit?).
    
    Corporate world critique embedded: Loyalty unrewarded (Jenkins devoted overlooked),
    meritocracy myth (connections ruthlessness luck matter talent secondary), humanity
    eroded (ethics obstacles, morality luxury, desperation manufactured). Player
    navigates understands - corporate ladder brutal, casualties numerous, Jenkins
    representative typical, sympathy complicated judgment nuanced.
    
    Character serves functions: Corporate quest giver (main storyline introduces),
    moral dilemma (innocent target player's choice), system critique (corporate culture
    exposed), betrayal potential (trust tested player expendable), consequences lasting
    (choices matter reputation affected alliances shifted). Memorable hoped - pathetic
    not pitiful, desperate not sympathetic entirely, corporate casualty self-made,
    judgment complicated intentionally.
  
  narrative_branches: |
    Jenkins' fate player-determined multiple endings: Promoted success (betrays player,
    karma eventual), exposed failure (arrested executed suicide), blackmailed stalemate
    (mutual leverage uneasy alliance), killed justice (player delivers, Arasaka investigates),
    escaped mercy (disappears guilt player's, resolution ambiguous). Replay value
    significant, consequences branching, player agency respected.
    
    Arasaka relationship affected: Execute successfully (reputation improved loyalty
    questioned), expose Jenkins (rewarded distrusted methods), betray report (loyalty
    demonstrated surveillance increased), refuse entirely (respected independence
    opportunities limited). Corporate world navigated carefully - cooperation selective,
    trust conditional, survival prioritized always.
  
  corporate_life_realism: |
    Jenkins represents corporate middle management reality: Overworked undervalued,
    loyalty exploited advancement denied, stress chronic fulfillment absent, identity
    consumed job. Details realistic - receding hairline stress, divorce workaholism,
    family disappointment, apartment sterile. Night City corporate satire grounded
    - not cartoonish villainy, banal evil mundane, system casualties recognizable,
    critique embedded naturally.
  
  voice_acting_notes: |
    Voice corporate stiff nervous - vocabulary business jargon, tone professional
    forced, stress audible (pitch higher tense, speech faster anxious, pauses calculated).
    Age 42 audible (не young enthusiastic, не old resigned, middle-aged desperate),
    Boston origins subtle accent (education polished, roots buried, class signaled).
    Manipulation transparent (sincerity absent, promises hollow, desperation evident),
    panic genuine stressed (voice cracks, excuses multiply, dignity abandoned). Player
    feels: Distrust warranted (lies obvious), pity possible (desperation real), contempt
    earned (choices reprehensible), complexity recognized (system victim self-made).
  
  integration_services:
    narrative_service: Jenkins corporate questline major (player introduction Arasaka
      world, moral choices significant, consequences lasting), branching outcomes
      (multiple endings, replay value, agency respected)
    faction_system: Arasaka relationship affected (loyalty tested, reputation varies,
      surveillance increased), corporate politics navigated (Jenkins' fate impacts
      player standing)
    reputation_system: Choices consequences (execute blindly reputation mixed, expose
      justice reputation improved, betray report loyalty demonstrated, refuse principles
      maintained)
    economy_system: Payments promised (hundred thousand total, partial potentially,
      betrayal affects), blackmail income (leverage maintained, eddies extracted ongoing)
    combat_system: Jenkins weak opponent (office worker typical, firearms poor, defeat
      easy), guards corporate employed (combat encounters possible, security response)
