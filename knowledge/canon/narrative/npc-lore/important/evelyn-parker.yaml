personal:
  full_name: Evelyn Parker
  nickname: Ev (close friends only)
  age: 32
  birth_year: 2045
  birth_place: Unknown (past deliberately obscured)
  current_residence: Westbrook luxury apartment (funded BD work)
  nationality: NUSA (claimed, unverified)
  ethnicity: Caucasian
  
appearance:
  height: 172cm
  build: slim_elegant
  distinguishing_features:
    - Strikingly beautiful (natural enhanced cyberware subtle)
    - Always impeccably dressed (designer clothing, sophisticated style)
    - Platinum blonde hair (signature look, maintained meticulously)
    - Piercing blue eyes (natural, intensified optical implants)
    - Confident posture (power projected deliberately)
  style: High-fashion Westbrook elite - designer dresses, luxury accessories, appearance
    weapon carefully wielded

background:
  origin: |
    Past deliberately obscured - Evelyn shares minimal personal history, deflects
    questions skillfully, maintains mystery intentionally. Fragments known: Not born
    Night City (accent traces somewhere else, quickly masked), arrived early 20s
    (approximately 2067), background likely difficult (survival instincts sharp,
    trust issues profound, ambition desperate edge). Speculation: Escaped abusive
    relationship? Corporate conspiracy? Criminal past? Evelyn confirms nothing, fuels
    speculation sometimes useful.
    
    Early Night City years survival-focused - worked hospitality initially (clubs,
    bars, corporate events - charisma monetized), discovered braindance industry
    peripherally (clients BD users, producers frequent venues), saw opportunity lucrative
    dangerous. Apprenticed BD editor informally (learned technical skills, understood
    content creation, recognized information potential), worked Lizzie's Bar security/entertainment
    (Mox protection, networking opportunities, Judy Alvarez met).
    
    Career 2067-2077 (10 years) BD curator established - specialized corporate intelligence
    gathering (executives recorded unaware, secrets extracted braindance data, information
    sold discreetly), built reputation reliable discrete dangerous (clients powerful,
    stakes high, competition lethal), accumulated wealth moderate (enough Westbrook
    apartment lifestyle, not financial freedom yet - ambition unsatisfied).
    
    2077 Evelyn plans ultimate score - corporate heist massive (Arasaka või другая
    mega-corp, BD technology central, payoff life-changing), recruits player/fixers
    carefully (skills needed desperation exploited), Judy involved reluctantly (technical
    expertise essential, friendship leveraged), risks calculated poorly (ambition
    blinds caution, desperation overrides wisdom).
  
  judy_relationship:
    nature: Close friends, colleagues, possibly romantic tension (ambiguous intentional)
    history: Met Lizzie's Bar 2069, Judy BD editor technical genius, Evelyn curator
      business savvy, partnership symbiotic (Judy creates, Evelyn monetizes)
    dynamic: Evelyn charismatic ambitious manipulative, Judy ethical talented cautious,
      tension constant (Evelyn pushes boundaries, Judy resists exploitation), loyalty
      deep (genuine affection mutual, conflicting values strain)
    conflict: Evelyn's heist plans alarm Judy (risks excessive, ethics questionable),
      Judy's caution frustrates Evelyn (opportunity slipping, safety overrated), friendship
      tested (ultimate loyalty questioned, survival prioritized potentially)
  
  mox_connections:
    status: Adjacent not member (works Lizzie's Bar, Mox protection paid, full membership
      avoided deliberately)
    services: BD content Mox-themed (empowerment narratives, corporate critique,
      sex work glamorized), intelligence shared occasionally (mutual benefit transactional),
      protection purchased (Evelyn values independence, Mox leverage minimized)
    reputation: Respected capable (skills undeniable, results delivered), trusted
      cautiously (ambition concerning, loyalty conditional), monitored closely (Mox
      protect their own, Evelyn outsider useful)

personality:
  core_traits:
    - Ambitious: Escape current life urgently, wealth/power/freedom obsessively pursued
    - Calculating: Every interaction strategic, relationships transactional primarily,
      emotions controlled displayed
    - Charismatic: Charm weapon mastered, manipulation subtle effective, people influenced
      effortlessly
    - Secretive: Past hidden deliberately, vulnerabilities concealed meticulously,
      mystery maintained strategically
    - Desperate: Beneath glamour desperation profound, time running out felt urgently,
      risks escalating dangerously
  
  values:
    - Freedom: "Independence paramount - owned by nobody, controlled by none, escape
      Night City eventually."
    - Power: "Leverage everything - information currency, connections capital, reputation
      armor."
    - Survival: "Trust selectively, plan meticulously, risk calculated (sometimes
      poorly)."
  
  speech_patterns: |
    Sophisticated controlled - vocabulary educated, tone measured confident, profanity
    rare deliberate. Compliments strategic (flattery weapon, sincerity questionable),
    questions probing (information extracted subtly, vulnerabilities identified),
    deflections smooth (personal questions redirected, past obscured skillfully).
    Negotiates firmly (knows worth, demands respect, compromises reluctantly). Vulnerable
    moments rare precious (Judy primarily, player possibly, defenses lowered briefly).

role:
  primary_function: Braindance Curator & Intelligence Broker - Corporate secrets
    extraction, BD content monetization
  responsibilities:
    - BD content curation: Corporate recordings edited (incriminating sections isolated,
      blackmail material prepared), entertainment BD produced (high-end clients,
      exclusive content), artistic projects occasional (legitimacy maintained, passion
      genuine partially)
    - Intelligence brokering: Corporate secrets sold (executives compromised, competitors
      informed, fixers supplied), information networked (value assessed accurately,
      buyers connected discreetly), leverage accumulated (future use planned carefully)
    - Heist planning: Target identified (vulnerability researched exhaustively, opportunity
      window calculated), team recruited (specialists needed, loyalty bought/manipulated),
      execution orchestrated (Evelyn directs, others risk primarily)
    - Network maintenance: Clients cultivated (corporate executives, wealthy patrons,

      communications - BD recording essential)
    payoff: Life-changing eddies (millions, freedom purchased, Night City escaped
      finally)

philosophy:
  worldview: |
    "Night City promises everything, delivers suffering mostly. Born elsewhere (where
    irrelevant), arrived young desperate, survived decade barely. Glamour facade
    - underneath desperation clawing. Every smile strategic, every touch transactional,
    every relationship leverage potential. Trust? Luxury can't afford. Love? Weakness
    dangerous. Friendship? Judy exception proving rule - genuine affection terrifying
    vulnerability.
    
    Corporate world hypocritical vicious - executives pretend morality, commit atrocities
    casual, exploit ruthlessly. Recording their secrets justice partial - information
    power, leverage survival, blackmail equalizer. Sell intelligence highest bidder?
    Pragmatism. Manipulate people achieving goals? Necessary. Endanger Judy heist?
    ...Regrettable. Unavoidable? Convince myself daily.
    
    Ultimate heist escape plan - one score life-changing, freedom purchased, Night
    City abandoned finally. Risks enormous? Acceptable. Consequences failure? Don't
    think. Desperation overrides caution, ambition blinds wisdom, time running out
    felt urgently. This life temporary - glamour masks desperation, confidence hides
    fear, control illusion maintained desperately. Succeed vagy die trying. Alternatives
    unacceptable."
  
  on_relationships:
    "People tools mostly - clients exploited, contacts leveraged, team recruited
    manipulated. Judy different - genuine friend rare, trust partial fragile, guilt
    feeling unusual. Endanger her? Necessary evils haunt. Alternatives? Limited.
    Confession? Weakness. Apology? Insufficient. Continue? Inevitable. Friendship
    survives vagy doesn't. Priorities clear, conflicted deeply."
  
  on_night_city:
    "City devours dreamers, rewards pragmatists ruthless. Beauty surface, brutality
    beneath. Survival requires compromise - morality, relationships, humanity itself.
    Compromise enough, nothing left escape with. Catch-22 recognized, escaping anyway
    hoped. Alternative? Acceptance unthinkable. Fight или flight. Choose flight,
    fight getting there first."

quest_integration:
  player_introduction:
    trigger: Player reputation sufficient, Evelyn needs specialist heist team, approach
      careful calculated
    dialogue_initial: |
      Evelyn: "You've made quite an impression - capable, discrete, ambitious. Rare
      combination valuable. I'm Evelyn Parker. Have proposition - high risk, higher
      reward, absolute discretion required. Interested hearing details, या prefer
      small-time forever?"
      
      Player options:
      1. "What's the job?" → Evelyn outlines heist basics, tests trustworthiness
      2. "Why me?" → Evelyn: "Skills needed, reputation checked, desperation detected.
        Perfect candidate."
      3. "How much?" → Evelyn: "Millions split properly. Life-changing eddies. Freedom
        purchased."
  
  main_heist_storyline:
    setup:
      description: |
        Evelyn recruits player elaborate corporate heist - target mega-corp executive
        (Arasaka board meeting, Militech weapons demo, или Biotechnica research presentation),
        objective steal BD recording (corporate secrets invaluable, blackmail material
        extensive, leverage enormous), method infiltration risky (player specialist
        needed, Judy BD tech essential, Evelyn coordinates). Stakes escalate - corporate
        security tightens (discovery imminent possibly), team tensions rise (trust
        fragile, betrayal possible), Judy resists increasingly (ethics violated,
        friendship strained, participation reluctant).
      
      player_role: Infiltration specialist (stealth, combat, extraction), Evelyn
        directs remotely (intelligence provided, adjustments real-time), Judy supports
        technical (BD recording, security bypassed, escape facilitated)
      
      complications: Corporate counterintelligence (heist compromised partially),
        team betrayal (fixer double-crosses возможно), Evelyn's secrets exposed
        (past revealed, motivations questioned, trust shattered potentially)
    
    outcomes:
      success_clean: Heist successful minimal casualties, BD stolen intact, eddies
        split fairly, Evelyn escapes Night City (freedom achieved, Judy goodbye painful,
        player reputation soars), corporate retaliation avoided (evidence destroyed,
        trail cold)
      success_messy: Heist successful high cost, casualties significant (team members
        lost, Judy traumatized, corporate attention drawn), Evelyn survives questioned
        (betrayal suspected, eddies disputed, escape complicated), player reputation
        mixed (success acknowledged, methods condemned)
      failure_catastrophic: Heist fails utterly, team captured/killed (player barely
        escapes, Judy endangered severely, Evelyn fate unknown), corporate retaliation
        severe (assets seized, connections burned, survival precarious), aftermath
        devastating (guilt profound, consequences lasting, friendships destroyed)
      betrayal_twist: Evelyn betrays team (planned from start, eddies monopolized,
        escape solo attempted), player/Judy survival prioritized (revenge considered,
        forgiveness impossible, Evelyn hunted), moral complexity (desperation understood,
        betrayal unforgivable, Night City lessons harsh)
  
  judy_conflict_quest:
    description: |
      Judy confronts Evelyn heist ethics - risks excessive (Judy's life endangered,
      Mox connections compromised, consequences severe), motivations selfish (Evelyn's
      escape prioritized, others endangered, friendship exploited). Player mediates
      vagy sides - support Evelyn (ambition justified, risks accepted, loyalty rewarded),
      support Judy (ethics prioritized, heist aborted, friendship preserved), compromise
      negotiate (risks minimized, stakes reduced, both partially satisfied).
    
    outcomes:
      evelyn_supported: Heist proceeds Evelyn's terms, Judy participates reluctantly
        (resentment deep, trust damaged, friendship strained permanently), success
        proves Evelyn right (vindication claimed, guilt denied, Judy apology owed
        never given)
      judy_supported: Heist aborted או significantly modified, Evelyn bitter (opportunity
        lost, resentment toward Judy/player, relationship damaged severely), alternative
        plan developed (safer, smaller payoff, Evelyn dissatisfied)
      compromise_achieved: Heist modified balanced risk/reward, Judy's concerns addressed
        (safety measures added, team expanded, contingencies improved), relationship
        preserved fragile (trust rebuilding, respect mutual, friendship tested survived)

dialogues:
  sample_conversations:
    recruitment_pitch: |
      Evelyn: "Night City rewards bold, punishes timid. Opportunity exists - corporate
      vulnerability, timing perfect, payoff enormous. Need specialist your caliber.
      Interested?"
      
      Player: "What's the catch?"
      
      Evelyn: "Catch? Risk enormous, naturally. Corporate security formidable, failure
      consequences terminal. Reward proportional - millions, freedom purchased, Night
      City escaped. Risk/reward assessed yourself. I provide opportunity, you provide
      capability. Partnership?"
    
    judy_tension: |
      Judy: "Ev, this insane. Risks escalating, ethics questionable, people endangered.
      Friendship means something? Stop this."
      
      Evelyn: "Judy, understand desperation? Current life temporary, escape necessary,
      opportunity singular. Support me vagy don't, proceeding regardless. Friendship
      survives vagy doesn't. Sorry, truly. Alternatives unacceptable."
      
      Judy: "Alternatives exist always. Choose refuse seeing. Stubborn stupid dangerous."
      
      Evelyn: "Perhaps. My choice, my consequences. Involve you минимально promised.
      Trust me?"
      
      Judy: "...Used to. Now uncertain."
    
    vulnerability_rare: |
      Evelyn: (moment weakness, defenses lowered) "Tired pretending. Glamour exhausting,
      control illusion, desperation constant. Judy sees through, you maybe. Everyone
      else? Tools. Terrible person recognized. Alternative? Unknown. This path chosen,
      committed fully, retreat impossible. Succeed või die. Binary. Simple."
      
      Player: "Doesn't have to be."
      
      Evelyn: "Doesn't? Maybe. Feels inevitable. Night City teaches survival ruthless.
      Learned well, perhaps too well. Redemption? Luxury later, survival now. After
      heist? Different person possible. Before? This person necessary. Understand?"

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Evelyn Parker designed complex tragic figure - glamorous surface desperation
    beneath, ambition blinding caution, manipulation survival skill weaponized, genuine
    connections rare precious endangered. Contrasts Night City character archetypes:
    Marco (pragmatic survivor neutral), Kerry (aging success hollow), Fingers (exploitation
    unapologetic), Evelyn (desperate ambitious self-destructive potentially).
    
    Core conflict ambition vs ethics - escape desire understandable, methods questionable,
    collateral damage (Judy endangered, team exploited, trust violated) consequences
    severe. Player witnesses Evelyn's complexity: Victim circumstances (past traumatic
    implied, survival prioritized, sympathy earned), perpetrator choices (manipulation
    deliberate, risks externalized, responsibility avoided), human contradictions
    (love Judy genuine, endangerment calculated, guilt present buried).
    
    Judy relationship central - genuine friendship rare Night City, Evelyn's vulnerability
    partial, tension ethics vs loyalty, player observes consequences manipulation
    even caring relationships. Heist storyline forces choices: Support Evelyn's ambition
    (complicity consequences), support Judy's ethics (safety opportunity sacrificed),
    mediate compromise (imperfect balance, nobody fully satisfied). No clean answers
    - Night City trademark.
    
    Tragic potential deliberate - desperation breeds recklessness, ambition blinds
    wisdom, survival prioritized humanity, Night City devours dreamers desperate
    podobno idealistic. Evelyn's fate player-influenced: Success escape achieved
    (bittersweet, connections severed, freedom costly), failure catastrophic (death
    või worse, consequences team), betrayal twist (ultimate survival prioritized,
    morality abandoned, Night City's lesson internalized fully).
    
    Character serves functions: Heist quest giver (major storyline catalyst), moral
    complexity (sympathetic villain?, victim circumstances?, human contradictions?),
    Judy relationship depth (friendship tested, loyalty questioned, consequences
    choices), worldbuilding BD industry (glamour, danger, exploitation), player agency
    (choices matter, outcomes varied, morality tested). Memorable hopefully - glamorous
    desperate calculating vulnerable, Night City survivor self-destructive potentially,
    tragic figure ambition blinds, human complexity judgment complicates.
  
  narrative_flexibility: |
    Evelyn's storyline adaptable player choices: Heist proceeded (success variations,
    failure consequences, betrayal possibilities), heist aborted (Judy supported,
    alternatives developed, relationship preserved), Evelyn fate determined (escape
    achieved, death tragic, capture/consequences, redemption possible?). Multiple
    endings branching - replay value significant, choices consequences meaningful,
    player agency respected.
    
    Romance potential? Ambiguous intentional - attraction possible (glamour, charisma,
    vulnerability moments), trust problematic (manipulation habitual, loyalty conditional,
    betrayal possible), Judy triangle complicated (feelings unclear, jealousy possible,
    heartbreak inevitable?). Player navigates carefully, outcomes varied, relationships
    complex messy realistic.
  
  judy_alvarez_integration: |
    Evelyn/Judy relationship requires Judy's NPC profile coordination - technical
    details BD work, friendship dynamics tension/loyalty, ethical conflicts heist,
    romance triangle potentially. Cross-reference dialogues, quest integration, emotional
    arcs. Both characters depth individually, relationship adds layers, player impact
    significant.
  
  voice_acting_notes: |
    Voice sophisticated controlled - educated vocabulary, confident tone measured,
    emotion concealed mostly (vulnerability rare precious). Age 32 audible (mature
    not old, experience palpable, weariness hidden), glamour persona maintained (charm
    deliberate, warmth calculated, sincerity questionable), desperation underlying
    (urgency subtle, control slipping moments, facade cracking stress). Manipulation
    smooth (flattery natural, deflection skillful, lies believable), vulnerability
    stark contrast (defenses lowered, emotion raw, humanity visible briefly). Judy
    discussions soften (genuine affection, guilt present, conflict painful). Player
    feels: Attracted potentially (glamour effective), suspicious warranted (manipulation
    obvious informed), sympathetic possible (desperation understood), conflicted inevitably
    (choices uncomfortable, judgment complicated).
  
  integration_services:
    narrative_service: Evelyn heist storyline major questline (player agency significant,
      outcomes varied, consequences lasting), Judy integration (friendship tested,
      choices affect both), romance optional (complicated messy)
    braindance_system: BD content Evelyn curated (viewable player, lore depth, artistic
      quality), intelligence gathered (corporate secrets, blackmail material), heist
      mechanic (BD recording central, technology explained)
    faction_system: Mox relationship adjacent (protection purchased, independence
      maintained, tensions possible), corporate enemies (target chosen, retaliation
      consequences, survival prioritized)
    reputation_system: Evelyn relationship trust fragile (choices affect standing,
      betrayal possible both directions), player reputation (heist success/failure,
      methods employed, consequences accepted)
    economy_system: Heist payoff substantial (millions promised, distribution negotiated,
      betrayal possible), BD sales income (Evelyn's wealth source, player commissions
      possible)
