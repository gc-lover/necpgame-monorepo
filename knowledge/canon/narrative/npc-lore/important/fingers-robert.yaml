  full_name: Robert Fingers MD
  nickname: Fingers
  age: 54

  birth_place: Pacifica, Night City
  current_residence: Japantown, Westbrook, Night City
  nationality: NUSA
  ethnicity: Caucasian
  
appearance:
  height: 175cm
  build: thin_wiry
  distinguishing_features:
    - Overly styled hair (attempts fashionable, achieves sleazy)
    - Excessive jewelry (gold chains, rings, flashy watch)
    - Perpetual smile (unsettling insincere)
    - Sweaty nervous demeanor (guilt? Anxiety? Both?)
  style: Cheap imitation luxury - knockoff designer clothing, counterfeit accessories,
    appearance trying-too-hard desperate

background:
  origin: |
    Born 2023 Pacifica slums, childhood poverty extreme. Father absent, mother junkie
    died overdose when Robert age 12, raised street-survival instincts. Education
    spotty - public schools violent underfunded, Robert learned survival skills primarily:
    Lie convincingly, manipulate constantly, exploit weaknesses ruthlessly. Teenage
    years petty crime (theft, scams, drug running minor), arrested multiple times
    juvenile (records sealed), learned lesson: Don't get caught, not stop crime.
    
    Age 18 (2041) discovered cyberware black market - profitable, dangerous, fascinating.
    Apprenticed underground ripper doc (unlicensed, criminal, skilled technically).
    Learned installation basics, medical procedures minimal, ethics absent entirely.
    Mentor arrested 2045 (botched surgery client died, NCPD crackdown), Robert inherited
    equipment/clientele, established own operation Japantown back-alley clinic.
    
    Career 2045-2077 (32 years) underground ripper - cheap implants questionable
    quality, stolen cyberware fenced regularly, surgery standards minimal (sterilization
    optional, anesthesia cheap, aftercare nonexistent). Clientele desperate - poor
    can't afford legit rippers, criminals avoiding records, addicts seeking implants
    fast cheap. Reputation sordid - botched surgeries occasional (infections, rejections,
    malfunctions), sexual misconduct alleged multiple times (clients vulnerable unconscious,
    Fingers opportunistic predatory), financial exploitation constant (hidden fees,
    shoddy work, planned obsolescence).
    
    Survived decades law enforcement proximity Mox territory - protection payments
    made reluctantly (Fingers resents, unable refuse), NCPD bribes regular (officers
    corrupted, raids avoided), clients desperate silent (complaining risks exposure
    criminal activities). Age 54 (2077), Fingers established Japantown fixture -
    everyone knows reputation, desperate enough ignore warnings, Fingers profits
    misery.
  
  medical_background:
    formal_education: None (no medical degree, licenses forged/expired)
    training: Underground apprenticeship 2041-2045 (4 years unlicensed mentor)

      surgery basic (complications common, success rate 70-80%), medical knowledge
      minimal (anatomy basics, pharmacology dangerous gaps)

  criminal_record:
    juvenile: Multiple arrests petty crimes (sealed records)
    adult:
      - Medical malpractice allegations: 7 cases (settled quietly, victims intimidated/bribed)
      - Sexual misconduct allegations: 4 cases (no convictions, evidence insufficient/suppressed)
      - Stolen cyberware fencing: Ongoing (never caught, connections protected)
      - Operating unlicensed medical facility: Technically illegal (NCPD paid ignore)
  
  family:
    parents: Deceased (father unknown, mother overdose 2035)
    siblings: None known
    relationships:
      - No long-term partnerships (personality repellent, trust impossible)
      - Transactional sexual encounters occasional (purchased, coerced, eller exploited
        clients unconscious - allegations unproven)
      - Isolation profound (wealth moderate, connections absent, respect zero)

personality:
  core_traits:
    - Greedy: Profit singular motivation, exploitation reflexive, generosity impossible
    - Sleazy: Demeanor unsettling, behavior inappropriate, boundaries violated casually
    - Cowardly: Confrontation avoided, threats capitulated immediately, survival
      prioritized dignity sacrificed
    - Manipulative: Lies habitual, charm superficial, victims blamed deflection automatic
    - Insecure: Overcompensates flashy appearance, craves respect never earns, defensiveness
      constant
  
  values:
    - Money: "Eddies solve everything - buy silence, safety, satisfaction temporary."
    - Self-preservation: "Survival paramount - pride luxury, cowardice pragmatism."
    - Convenience: "Easy eddies best eddies - why work hard when shortcuts available?"
  
  speech_patterns: |
    Overly familiar inappropriate - calls everyone "baby," "sweetheart," "choom"
    uninvited. Compliments insincere creepy ("Looking good today, real good"). Deflects
    criticism immediate ("Not my fault - client's body rejected, cheap implants expected").
    Negotiates desperate ("How about discount? We friends, right?"). Lies smooth
    reflexive ("Totally legal, completely safe, trust me"). Nervous laughter punctuates
    (guilt? Anxiety? Habit?). Profanity minimal (attempts professional veneer thin).

      minimal, complications frequent
    - Black market fencing: Stolen cyberware bought/sold, corporate shipments hijacked

      classified, trust broken irreparably)

    intimidation: Zero (cowardice obvious, threats laughable)
  
  combat:
    firearms: Basic (pistol owned, training minimal, accuracy poor)
    hand-to-hand: Pathetic (avoids conflict absolutely, loses fights instantly)
    survival_instincts: High (runs fast, hides well, begs effectively)

      ignored)
  
  personal:
    clothing: Knockoff designer (logos misspelled subtly, fabric cheap)
    jewelry: Counterfeit gold (plating worn, green skin discoloration telltale)
    apartment: Above clinic (cramped, messy, lonely)
    vehicle: None (public transport suffices, afford car but paranoid theft)

philosophy:
  worldview: |
    "Night City brutal - eat vagy eaten, exploit vagy exploited. Born nothing Pacifica,
    survived decades Japantown dangerous, earned eddies however possible. Moral?
    Morality luxury rich afford. Poor need pragmatism - shortcuts, corners cut, rules
    bent. Clients complain? Choose elsewhere - oh wait, can't afford legitimate.
    My services necessary evil. Provide demand, profit misery, survive another day.
    
    Reputation bad? Deserved partially. Botched surgeries? Happened. Misconduct allegations?
    Overblown mostly. Clients vulnerable, rumors spread, evidence lacking. Not monster
    - opportunist. Night City rewards opportunists, punishes idealists. Chose survival
    over principles. Regret? Sometimes. Change? Never. Too late, too profitable,
    too scared alternatives."
  
  on_clients:
    "Desperate people poor decisions make. My responsibility? Install chrome, collect
    eddies, move next. Aftercare? Complications? Not my problem - signed waivers
    (forged, але signed). Clients knew risks (didn't, але claim did). Sympathy expensive
    - can't afford myself, certainly not clients."
  
  on_mox:
    "Protection racket disguised community service. Pay monthly või face consequences
    - broken windows, supplier problems, NCPD raids sudden. Resent? Absolutely. Refuse?
    Suicidal. Mox necessary evil tolerate. Judy especially - self-righteous hypocrite,
    judges me constantly. Like she's perfect. Everyone compromises Night City. Hers
    invisible, mine obvious. Difference?"

quest_integration:
  player_introduction:
    trigger: Player needs cheap implants urgently, directed Fingers Japantown (warnings
      ignored desperation)
    dialogue_initial: |
      Fingers: "Well well, new face. Fingers MD - best ripper doc Japantown, competitive
      prices, no questions asked. Need chrome installed? Got everything - Kiroshi
      optics knock-offs, Sandevistan budget versions, mantis blades factory seconds.
      Cheap fast discrete. What you need, baby?"
      
      Player options:
      1. "Are you licensed?" → Fingers: "Licenses bureaucratic nonsense. Skills matter,
        paperwork doesn't. Thirty years experience, thousands satisfied clients."
      2. "Heard bad things about you." → Fingers: "Rumors exaggerated - competitors
        jealous, clients ungrateful. Judge yourself, choom."
      3. "Show me what you have." → Fingers displays inventory (quality concerning,
        prices tempting)
  
  moral_dilemma_quests:
    expose_fingers:
      description: |
        Player discovers Fingers' misconduct evidence - medical records falsified,
        sexual assault allegations documented, stolen cyberware manifests. Choice:
        Expose publicly (Fingers arrested possibly, clinic closed, desperate clients
        lose access), report Mox (Judy handles internally, violence likely), ignore
        (profit Fingers continues, victims suffer ongoing), या blackmail (eddies
        extorted, complicity shared).
      
      outcomes:
        expose_public: Fingers arrested (trial delayed bribes), clinic closed temporarily
          (reopens elsewhere), desperate clients suffer (no alternative cheap), player
          reputation mixed (justice served, collateral damage)
        report_mox: Judy confronts Fingers (violence threatened), Fingers pays reparations
          forced, clinic continues monitored closely, victims compensated partially
        ignore: Fingers continues (status quo maintained), guilt player's (complicity
          passive), victims suffer ongoing (exploitation unchecked)
        blackmail: Fingers pays reluctantly (resentment deep), player compromised
          morally (eddies tainted), relationship hostile (betrayal inevitable)
    
    save_victim:
      description: |
        Player witnesses Fingers victimize client unconscious - inappropriate touching,
        photos taken, procedure unnecessarily prolonged. Intervene immediately (violence
        likely, Fingers coward flees), report after (evidence needed, victim trauma
        compounds), ignore (complicity passive, regret likely).
      
      outcomes:
        intervene: Fingers beaten/threatened (coward confesses), victim rescued (trauma
          minimized), clinic access lost (Fingers refuses service), Mox grateful
          (reputation boost)
        report_after: Investigation launched (evidence gathered), victim interviewed
          (trauma relived), Fingers denies (lawyer hired), trial prolonged (justice
          delayed)
        ignore: Victim suffers (trauma compounds), player haunted (guilt persistent),
          Fingers continues (emboldened)
    
    desperate_choice:
      description: |
        Player critically injured, legitimate rippers unavailable (hours closed, too
        expensive, too far), Fingers only option. Accept substandard treatment (infection
        risk, malfunction possible, survival likely), risk death refusing (pride costly),
        compromise negotiate (Fingers prices surge desperation exploited).
      
      outcomes:
        accept_treatment: Survival achieved (barely), complications emerge (infection
          treated later, implant malfunction occasional), debt owed Fingers (leverage
          gained), moral compromise (hypocrisy recognized)
        refuse_die: Player dies (pride ultimate price), game over (respawn), lesson
          learned (pragmatism survival sometimes)
        negotiate: Fingers extorts (prices tripled), player pays (eddies drained),
          treatment adequate (Fingers motivated avoid death investigation), resentment
          mutual

dialogues:
  sample_conversations:
    first_meeting_warnings: |
      NPC Stranger: "Going see Fingers? Careful, choom. Cheap prices, expensive mistakes.
      Friend got infected implant - nearly died sepsis. Another claims... inappropriate
      things happened unconscious. Can't prove, але warnings clear. Desperate only."
      
      Player: "No alternatives?"
      
      Stranger: "Legitimate rippers expensive. Viktor Vector Watson - ethical, skilled,
      pricey. Fingers cheap dangerous. Choose carefully."
    
    fingers_defensive: |
      Player: "Heard complaints about your work."
      
      Fingers: "Complainers everywhere - ungrateful, unrealistic expectations. Charge
      bargain prices, provide bargain results. Want premium? Pay premium elsewhere.
      My clients understand trade-offs. You don't? Door's there."
      
      Player: "What about misconduct allegations?"
      
      Fingers: "Lies - bitter clients, jealous competitors, self-righteous Mox. Never
      proven anything because nothing happened. Reputation attacks, character assassination.
      Still here, still working. Means something, right?"
    
    judy_confrontation: |
      Judy: "Fingers, we need talk. Complaints mounting - clients uncomfortable, work
      shoddy, behavior inappropriate. This ends now või clinic ends. Clear?"
      
      Fingers: "Judy, baby, exaggerations-"
      
      Judy: "Call me 'baby' again, I'll break your fingers - fitting, yeah? Complaints
      documented, evidence gathered. One more incident, you're done. Mox protection
      withdrawn, NCPD notified, clinic shuttered. Understand?"
      
      Fingers: "...Understood. Won't happen again."
      
      Judy: "Better not. Watching closely now."

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Fingers Robert designed morally reprehensible NPC - exploitation embodied, player
    discomfort intentional, ethical dilemmas forced. Night City's brutality spectrum
    wide - honorable characters (Viktor Vector, Misty), pragmatic survivors (Marco
    Sanchez), outright villains (Fingers). Fingers occupies despicable-но-useful
    niche - services needed desperate, personality repellent, choices uncomfortable.
    
    Character deliberately unlikeable: Sleazy demeanor, predatory behavior, cowardice
    profound, greed singular motivation. Appearance trying-too-hard (knockoff luxury,
    cheap imitation wealth), speech inappropriate familiar (unsolicited terms endearment,
    deflection reflexive), actions reprehensible (medical malpractice, sexual misconduct
    alleged, financial exploitation routine). Player viscerally dislikes - design
    intentional.
    
    Moral complexity nuanced: Fingers evil? Partially. Product environment? Absolutely.
    Born poverty, survived brutality, learned exploitation survival. Justifications
    thin (morality luxury, pragmatism necessity), але context matters. Night City
    creates Fingers - desperation breeds predators, systems fail vulnerable, alternatives
    absent. Player judges Fingers, system created him examined simultaneously.
    
    Quest integration forces uncomfortable choices: Use Fingers services (complicity
    exploitation), expose publicly (justice served, collateral damage desperate lose
    access), report Mox (violence likely, resolution unclear), ignore (passive complicity,
    guilt compounds). No clean answers - Night City trademark. Player agency respected,
    consequences significant, morality tested.
    
    Mox relationship tension-filled: Fingers proximity territory requires protection
    payments, services sex workers problematic (predatory behavior, client complaints),
    Judy's hatred profound (Evelyn Parker incident catalytic - details player discovers).
    Mox tolerate reluctantly (alternative ripper difficult, monitoring intensive),
    termination desired (violations punished severely, clinic closure possible).
    
    Viktor Vector contrast deliberate: Viktor ethical skilled expensive (golden standard),
    Fingers unethical shoddy cheap (desperate alternative). Player chooses based
    values/resources - rich afford Viktor principles, poor tolerate Fingers compromises.
    Economic determinism moral choices questioned - privilege enables ethics, poverty
    forces compromises. Uncomfortable truth Night City reality.
    
    Character serves functions: Moral dilemma generator (player choices uncomfortable),
    worldbuilding (Night City's underbelly exposed), quest giver reluctant (services
    needed despite revulsion), cautionary tale (exploitation unchecked consequences),
    player discomfort intentional (not every NPC likeable, some despicable). Memorable
    hopefully - reasons wrong. Disgust earned, choices forced, Night City brutality
    embodied single sleazy ripper doc.
  
  content_warnings: |
    Fingers Robert character involves mature themes: Sexual misconduct (alleged, implicit,
    never graphic), medical malpractice (botched surgeries, infections, negligence),
    exploitation vulnerable (unconscious clients, desperate poor, sex workers). Content
    handled maturely - implications clear, details tasteful, player agency respected
    (choices opt-out possible). Discomfort intentional educational - Night City's
    darkness illustrated, predators exist, systems fail, vigilance necessary.
  
  voice_acting_notes: |
    Voice sleazy insincere - overly smooth hiding nervousness, inappropriate familiarity
    unsettling, nervous laughter punctuating (guilt? Anxiety?). Age 54 audible (не
    young, не old, middle-aged desperation), Pacifica origins subtle accent (poverty
    roots), charm superficial transparent (manipulation obvious). Defensive moments
    immediate (accusations deflected, victims blamed, justifications weak), cowardice
    audible confronted (voice cracks, excuses multiply, capitulation fast). Greed
    drips sentences ("Eddies upfront," "Extra charges," "Discount impossible"), insecurity
    compensates (boasting hollow, compliments fishing, respect craved never earned).
    
    Player feels: Discomfort intended (skin crawls slightly), distrust automatic (lies
    obvious), disgust earned (behavior reprehensible), pity possible (продукт environment,
    victim circumstances). Complex emotions - hatred pure, understanding nuanced,
    choices uncomfortable. Voice actor sells sleaze - difficult role, essential contrast,
    Night City spectrum embodied.
  
  integration_services:
    quest_engine: Fingers provides cyberware services (cheap dangerous), moral dilemma
      quests (expose, ignore, exploit), reputation consequences (choices affect standing)
    economy_system: Black market cyberware (stolen goods fenced), services budget-tier
      (cheap risky), payment flexible (cash, trade, коercед - latter implications
      only)
    faction_system: Mox relationship hostile-necessary (protection payments, monitoring,
      termination possible), NCPD bribed (raids avoided, misconduct ignored), clients
      desperate (no alternatives, complaints silenced)
    reputation_system: Fingers reputation terrible (warnings universal, desperate
      use anyway), player choices affect (expose heroic, use complicit, exploit villainous)
    health_system: Cyberware installed (malfunction risk high, infection possible,
      humanity cost significant), medical services (gunshot wounds, overdoses, infections
      - standards minimal)
