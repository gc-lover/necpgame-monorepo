background:
  origin: |
    Born 1988 Texas, childhood ordinary middle-class. Discovered music teenage years
    (guitar, vocals, composition), moved California early 20s pursuing rock dreams.
    Met Johnny Silverhand 2008 through underground music scene, formed Samurai band
    shortly after (lineup: Johnny vocals/guitar, Kerry lead guitar/vocals, Henry bass,
    Denny drums). Band exploded 2010s-2020s - anti-corporate anthems, rebellious image,
    massive following youth disillusioned corporate dystopia. "Chippin' In" (2013),
    "Never Fade Away" (2020), "Black Dog" (2019) iconic hits generations.
    
    Samurai dissolved 2023 dramatic fallout - Johnny's radicalization (terrorism Arasaka
    Tower 2023, died mission), Kerry devastated personally/professionally. Band's
    lead vocalist/soul gone, Kerry's best friend killed, music industry legacy complicated
    terrorism association. Kerry continued solo career 2023-present (54 years), success
    moderate - respected technically, але never matched Samurai magic. Johnny's ghost
    haunts - comparisons constant, legacy overshadows, Kerry's achievements dismissed
    "not Johnny."
    
    2077 Kerry age 89, maintained cybernetically (life-extension treatments wealthy
    afford, body sculpting perpetual youth aesthetic). Lives North Oak mansion Westbrook
    (luxury neighborhood corporate elites celebrities), wealth accumulated decades
    music royalties/investments. Outwardly successful - mansion, eddies, fame, respect.
    Inwardly struggling - mid-life crisis (technically late-life, але cyber-youth confuses),
    artistic stagnation, Johnny's absence/presence simultaneous (dead 54 years, legacy
    alive culturally), purpose questioned.

  speech_patterns: |
    Rock star charisma aged - confident performative public, vulnerable introspective
    private. Profanity casual (rock culture), slang dated (2020s references betray
    age), humor self-deprecating defensive. Philosophical drunk - "Life's performance,
    audience leaves eventually, stage empty always." Passionate music discussed -
    technical knowledge deep, enthusiasm infectious, critique harsh (perfectionist).
    Johnny mentioned frequently - reverence, resentment, grief mixed inextricably.
    "Johnny would've hated this" / "Johnny would've loved that" - comparison perpetual.

philosophy:
  worldview: |
    "Music transcends - corporations, politics, mortality temporary. Songs eternal.
    Samurai proved that - Johnny dead 54 years, 'Never Fade Away' still anthem. What
    legacy leave beyond? Struggled answering decades. Success achieved young - fame,
    eddies, respect. What next? More same? Different entirely? Retirement unthinkable
    - musicians die stages või forgotten. Neither acceptable.
    
    Johnny's ghost complicates - best friend, creative partner, revolutionary icon.
    His death 2023 ended Samurai, started myth. I'm footnote his legend. 'Kerry
    Eurodyne, Samurai guitarist.' Not 'Kerry Eurodyne, artist.' Resent? Absolutely.
    Understand? Completely. Johnny burned bright, died young-ish (35), legacy frozen
    perfection. I lived long, compromised, aged. Rebellion vs survival. Johnny chose
    former, I latter. Heroic või cowardly? Depends who asks.
    
    Now age 89 (biologically 50-ish), wealth accumulated, comfort assured, purpose
    uncertain. Young artists hungry remind me - passion uncorrupted, dreams unspoiled,
    energy infectious. Mentor them hoping recapture something lost. Maybe their success
    validates mine. Maybe just postponing inevitable irrelevance. Fuck knows. Keep
    playing until answer emerges. või stops mattering. Whichever comes first."
  
  on_music:
    "Rock rebellion originally - anti-corpo, anti-establishment, anti-bullshit. Samurai
    embodied that. Johnny especially. Songs weapons, concerts battles, audiences
    armies. Naive? Maybe. Effective? Somewhat. Meaningful? Absolutely. Solo career
    lost edge - comfortable, safe, profitable. Selling rebellion commodified. Hypocrisy
    recognized, justifications weak. Young artists carry torch now. I hold ladder.
    Best can do."
  
  on_johnny:
    "Johnny Silverhand - best friend, rival, ghost, legend. Loved him, hated him,
    miss him, resent him. Complicated. His death 2023 destroyed me. His legend 2077
    defines me. Can't escape, don't want to entirely. Samurai greatest achievement
    my life. Johnny's sacrifice made myth. I'm witness. Important role, unglamorous.
    Accept? Learning. Decades late, але learning."
  
  on_night_city:
    "City changed 89 years. Born 1988 elsewhere, moved here 2000s young musician.
    Night City promised freedom - artistic, personal, financial. Delivered partially.
    Fame achieved, wealth accumulated, freedom questioned. City devours - idealists,
    dreamers, rebels. Spits out - pragmatists, survivors, sell-outs. Johnny devoured
    young, legend eternal. I survived long, complicated mortality. City's verdict?
    Pending. Audiences decide. History judges. I play."

quest_integration:
  player_introduction:
    trigger: Player completes Westbrook access, reputation sufficient, musical quest
      chain initiated
    dialogue_initial: |
      "So you're the merc everyone talks about. Kerry Eurodyne. Samurai guitarist,
      solo artist five decades, Westbrook recluse currently. Heard impressive things
      your work. Need someone understands discretion, handles delicate situations.
      Music industry brutal - young artist signed predatory contract, corpo squeezing
      dry, needs extraction. Interested? Pay good, cause better. Maybe jam after
      successful? Been decades played someone gives shit music over eddies."
  
  storylines:
    rebel_path:
      description: |
        Kerry recruits player elaborate scheme: Sabotage corpo music label exploiting
        young artists (contracts predatory, profits corpo-dominated, artists pennies).
        Plan multi-stage - expose contracts illegally (netrunner infiltration), publicize
        exploitation (media campaign coordinated), organize artist collective (union-esque
        protection), pressure legislative reform (unlikely но attempt). Player handles
        physical operations (infiltration, protection, enforcement), Kerry provides
        connections/resources/motivation. Echoes Samurai's anti-corpo legacy, Kerry
        reclaims rebellious spirit, legacy beyond Johnny's shadow potential.
      
      outcomes:
        success: Corpo label reformed partially (artists better contracts), collective
          established (mutual support), Kerry reinvigorated (purpose rediscovered),
          player reputation Westbrook soars
        failure: Corpo retaliation severe (artists blacklisted, Kerry reputation damaged),
          publicity backfires (painted agitators), reform blocked (money wins), Kerry
          disillusioned deeper
    
    legacy_concert:
      description: |
        Kerry organizes Samurai tribute concert massive - 54th anniversary Johnny's
        death 2023, Never Fade Away performed legendary, audience hundreds thousands
        (virtual/physical combined), pero complications emerge: Arasaka threatens
        lawsuit (Johnny's terrorism association, brand damage alleged), venue threatened
        sabotage (corpo agents?, rival artists?), Kerry's confidence wavers (impostor
        syndrome, Johnny's shadow overwhelming). Player ensures concert succeeds -
        security managed, sabotage prevented, Kerry supported emotionally, performance
        triumphant. Kerry confronts Johnny's ghost finally, acceptance achieved partial,
        legacy shared не overshadowed.
      
      outcomes:
        triumphant: Concert legendary (reviews ecstatic, streams millions), Kerry's
          confidence restored (capable without Johnny), Samurai legacy honored authentically,
          player friendship Kerry deepened
        compromised: Concert decent (technical issues, emotional struggles visible),
          Kerry's doubts linger (not enough?), legacy questioned, relationship player
          strained
    
    mentorship_arc:
      description: |
        Kerry mentors young artist Us Cracks (band name) - talented, idealistic, naive.
        Reminds Kerry Samurai early days. Takes under wing - studio access provided,
        connections made, advice given generously. Pero complications: Us Cracks signed
        corpo contract predatory (Kerry warned, ignored youthful invincibility), creative
        control stripped (corpo demands commercial formula), disillusionment sets
        rapidly. Kerry must choose: Respect their autonomy (painful lesson learned
        hard way), intervene forcefully (contract sabotaged, career risked, relationship
        strained), compromise negotiate (balance protection/growth). Player assists
        operations, witnesses Kerry's paternal side (hidden usually isolation luxury).
      
      outcomes:
        protective: Kerry buys out contract (eddies spent freely), Us Cracks independent
          (grateful, dependent), lessons learned partially (protected от consequences)
        autonomous: Us Cracks suffer contract (exploitation experienced firsthand),
          Kerry supports emotionally (não financially rescue), lessons learned hard
          (wisdom earned pain), eventual recovery stronger
        balanced: Negotiation achieves compromise (contract modified fair terms),
          Us Cracks autonomy respected (Kerry guidance available not imposed), relationship
          healthy mutual-respect

dialogues:
  sample_conversations:
    first_meeting: |
      Kerry: "You've got a reputation - reliable, discrete, dangerous when necessary.
      Rare combination. I need someone like that. Music industry glamorous surface,
      brutal underneath. Young artists exploited daily. Want help fix that?"
      
      Player options:
      1. "Why me?" → Kerry explains your reputation, capabilities unique
      2. "What's in it for me?" → Kerry: "Eddies obviously, connections valuable,
        maybe friendship worth something still?"
      3. "Tell me more." → Kerry details situation, recruitment pitch full
    
    discussing_johnny: |
      Player: "You knew Johnny Silverhand?"
      
      Kerry: "Knew him? Best friend 15 years. Formed Samurai together, played thousands
      shows, lived same dream. His death 2023... destroyed me. Everyone remembers
      Johnny - revolutionary, martyr, legend. Few remember Kerry - guitarist, survivor,
      complicated. His ghost follows everywhere. Love him, resent him, miss him deeply.
      54 years haven't resolved those feelings. Doubt ever will."
      
      Player options:
      1. "Must be hard." → Kerry: "Every day. But also privilege. Knew Johnny real,
        not legend. Memories mine, priceless."
      2. "He's still famous." → Kerry: "Fame posthumous easiest - no aging, compromising,
        disappointing. I aged, compromised, disappointed. Still here. Worth something?"
      3. "You're legendary too." → Kerry: "Kind words. Audience decides legends,
        not self-proclamation. Jury still out."
    
    music_philosophy: |
      Kerry: "Music transcends everything - corpo bullshit, political games, mortality
      even. Songs outlive creators. Samurai proved that. Johnny gone 54 years, 'Never
      Fade Away' still played daily. My solo work? Decent, forgotten mostly. What
      separates legends från footnotes? Fuck if I know. Still trying figure out."
      
      Player: "Your music matters."
      
      Kerry: "To whom? Young artists don't know me - 'Kerry who? Samurai guitarist?'
      Old fans remember Johnny primarily. Solo career respectable not remarkable.
      Age 89, wealth secure, legacy uncertain. Maybe mentoring young artists - their
      success my vindication. Maybe just ego refusing quiet retirement. Time will
      tell."
    
    invitation_jam: |
      Kerry: "You play anything? Music, I mean. No? Shame. Therapeutic. Been playing
      six decades - guitar extensions hands, songs second language. Studio North
      Oak always open you. Jam sometime? No judgment, pure fun. Rare these days.
      Everything performance, evaluation, commodified. Miss jamming for joy alone.
      Johnny understood that. Few others do."
      
      Player options:
      1. Accept → Unlocks jam session quest (learn guitar basics, bond Kerry, music
        appreciation)
      2. Decline → Kerry: "Your loss. Offer stands. Music heals - violence breaks.
        Balance needed."

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Kerry Eurodyne designed aging rock star legend - success achieved, purpose questioned,
    legacy complicated Johnny Silverhand's overwhelming presence. Age 89 (biologically
    ~50 cyber-maintained) significant - survived decades Night City music industry
    (brutal exploitative), accumulated wealth/fame, але happiness elusive. Samurai
    period (2008-2023) career peak - anti-corpo anthems, rebellious image, brotherhood
    Johnny, artistic fulfillment complete. Johnny's death 2023 ended chapter Kerry
    never recovered fully - best friend killed, creative partner lost, band dissolved,
    solo career shadow Samurai always.
    
    Personality complex layers: Public persona rock star charismatic (decades performance
    practiced), private self vulnerable isolated (wealth luxury barriers connections
    authentic), creative genius frustrated stagnated (inspiration inconsistent age/motivation),
    mentor generous conflicted (young artists remind what lost, helping them redemption
    seeking). Johnny's ghost omnipresent - comparisons constant ("not as good Johnny"),
    resentment/reverence mixed, grief unresolved 54 years later, legacy burden heavy.
    
    Mid-life crisis (technically late-life però cyber-youth confuses) central characterization
    - "What now?" eternal question. Fame achieved, wealth accumulated, respect earned,
    purpose unclear. Young artists hungry passionate remind Kerry what was - music
    rebellion не commodity, performances cathartic не transactions, connections authentic
    не superficial. Mentorship Kerry's redemption path - passing torch, validating
    legacy beyond Johnny's shadow, reclaiming rebellious spirit Samurai embodied.
    
    Westbrook setting perfect - luxury isolation North Oak mansion (wealth display
    emotional barriers), music industry connections maintained (relevance holding),
    celebrity circles superficial (fame's loneliness), creative stagnation luxury-induced
    (comfort kills urgency). Contrasts Watson's Marco (scrappy survivor neutral),
    Kerry (wealthy legend searching meaning). Night City's diversity characters socioeconomic
    spectrum - street fixers corporate musicians working-class rebels luxury celebrities.
    
    Quest integration demonstrates themes: Rebel Path (reclaiming anti-corpo spirit
    Samurai legacy honors), Legacy Concert (Johnny's ghost confronted acceptance
    partial), Mentorship Arc (wisdom transmitted young artists Kerry's purpose renewed).
    Player witnesses Kerry vulnerability (rare luxury penetrated), supports emotionally
    (friendship earned not bought), participates music world Westbrook (glamour brutality
    simultaneously). Romance potential? Ambiguous (age gap significant, emotional
    availability questionable, connection deep possible).
    
    Samurai legacy carefully handled - respect original Cyberpunk lore (Johnny Silverhand
    iconic, band legendary 2020s), expand Kerry's perspective (survivor's guilt,
    footnote frustration, complicated grief), avoid diminishing Johnny (legend deserved
    earned) while elevating Kerry (own achievements recognized). Balance difficult
    achievable - both can be legendary different ways. Johnny revolutionary martyr,
    Kerry survivor artist. Both valuable, both complicated, both human.
    
    Music industry critique embedded - predatory contracts (artists exploited systematically),
    corpo commodification (rebellion packaged sold), authenticity vs commercial success
    (compromise inevitable?), aging artists industry discards (youth obsession cruel),
    legacy vs relevance (past glories future uncertainties). Kerry embodies tensions
    - survived compromising, wealth accumulated integrity questioned, mentorship redemption
    seeking, music still matters despite everything.
    
    Character serves functions: Quest giver (Westbrook music storylines), moral complexity
    (success doesn't equal happiness), Johnny Silverhand connection (legend humanized
    Kerry's perspective), worldbuilding music industry (glamour brutality exposed),
    mentor figure (wisdom transmission), emotional depth (vulnerability wealth can't
    hide). Memorable hopefully - aging rocker seeking meaning, legend's shadow escaping,
    music transcending everything tried, humanity cyber-maintained tenuously, Night
    City survivor decades complicated.
  
  voice_acting_notes: |
    Voice rock star aged - confident performative public, vulnerable introspective
    private. Age 89 audible subtly (vocal cords cyber-maintained però emotional weight
    decades palpable). Texas origins trace accent (decades Night City softened però
    occasional), rock culture profanity casual ("fuck" punctuation not aggression),
    slang dated (2020s references betray age generationally). Musical discussions
    animated - technical passion, perfectionist critique, enthusiasm infectious. Johnny
    mentioned emotional shift - reverence (hero worship), resentment (overshadowed),
    grief (unresolved 54 years). Philosophical drunk moments vulnerability maximum
    - defenses lowered, truth raw, connection authentic possible. Humor self-deprecating
    defensive - laughs pain, jokes armor, warmth underneath rare precious. Performance
    mode singing transcendent - decades virtuoso, emotion channeled music pure, audience
    connection profound when inspired.
