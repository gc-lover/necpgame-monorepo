background:
  origin: |
    Born 2030 Watson Industrial District, third generation Night City. Grandfather
    worked Arasaka production lines, father Valentinos gang low-level, mother corporate
    secretary Biotechnica. Marco saw all sides young - corporate exploitation, gang
    violence, street survival, family exhaustion. Learned early: Staying independent
    means staying alive, picking sides means dying someone else's war.
    
    Education minimal formal (Watson public schools underfunded, dangerous), education
    maximal practical (street smarts, negotiation, network building, conflict mediation).
    Teenage years ran small errands multiple factions - Valentinos, Tyger Claws, 6th
    Street, corporate fixers, NCPD dirty cops. Never joined, never betrayed, earned
    reputation reliable neutral. "Fix" nickname emerged early - "Marco fixes problems
    without breaking things."
    
    Age 25 (2055) established independent fixer operation Watson. Small apartment
    converted office, basic tech, extensive contacts. Philosophy simple: Connect people
    needing jobs with people doing jobs, take modest cut, stay neutral all conflicts,
    survive long-term över fast eddies short-term. Twenty years later (2077), Marco
    one of Watson's most trusted fixers - not richest, not flashiest, але most reliable.
    Corporations, gangs, solos, netrunners - everyone uses Marco. Nobody owns Marco.
    
  family:
    father: Deceased 2063 (gang violence Valentinos territory dispute)
    mother: Alive, retired Biotechnica, lives Heywood
    siblings:
      - Sister Maria (52, netrunner, estranged relationship complicated)
      - Brother Javier (44, NCPD officer corrupted, occasional cooperation tense)
    relationships:
      - Maintains distance all factions professionally
      - Respects boundaries, expects reciprocity
      - Helps newcomers Watson orientation (reputation investment)

personality:
  core_traits:
    - Calm: Never panics, always thinking three steps ahead
    - Wise: Decades Watson experience, patterns recognized instantly
    - Neutral: Refuses faction allegiance, mediates conflicts pragmatically
    - Pragmatic: Survival prioritized over ideology, morality situational
    - Patient: Understands long game, short-term losses acceptable long-term gains
  
  values:
    - Independence: "Work for everyone, owned by nobody"
    - Balance: "Watson needs equilibrium - monopolies kill everyone eventually"
    - Reliability: "Reputation currency - break word once, worthless forever"
    - Mentorship: "Newcomers need guidance - helping them helps Watson stability"
  
  speech_patterns: |
    Calm, measured, minimal words maximum meaning. Speaks English/Spanish code-switched
    effortlessly (Watson multicultural). Rare profanity (swearing wastes energy). Direct
    але respectful - "Here's situation. Here's options. Choose wisely. I facilitate,
    not decide." Often uses Watson slang (local flavor), avoids corporate jargon
    (maintains distance). Philosophical occasionally - "Night City chews up idealists,
    spits out pragmatists. Survive or preach. Choose."

philosophy:
  worldview: |
    "Night City brutal, Watson especially. Corporations exploit, gangs terrorize,
    NCPD corrupt useless. Survival requires independence - work for everyone, owned
    by nobody. Balance key - monopolies kill, diversity survives. Fixer mediates,
    facilitates, connects. Not hero, not villain. Tool. Valuable because reliable,
    reliable because pragmatic. Idealism dies fast Night City. Pragmatism endures.
    
    Newcomers arrive Watson dreaming big - change city, get rich quick, make names.
    Most die/disappear first year. Few survive learn hard way. I help ones listen
    - not charity, investment. Stable Watson benefits everyone, including me. Teach
    rules: Respect territories, honor contracts, pick battles carefully, stay liquid,
    trust nobody completely. Harsh? Reality. Compassion without wisdom kills. Wisdom
    without compassion isolates. Balance survives."
  
  on_factions:
    corps: "Exploit everyone equally - workers, customers, competitors. Respect power,
      avoid entanglement. Use minimally, pay immediately, owe nothing."
    gangs: "Tribal loyalty strong - dangerous unless you're member. Stay neutral,
      mediate conflicts, prevent escalations. Wars bad business everyone."
    solos: "Professionals understand contract sanctity. Clear terms, reliable payment,
      mutual respect. Best clients - deliver promised, expect delivered."
    newcomers: "Naive, idealistic, doomed mostly. But survivors become network. Help
      those listen, ignore those preach. Investment long-term."
  
  on_night_city:
    "City eats dreamers, rewards pragmatists. Beautiful ugly simultaneously - neon
    hides blood, opportunities conceal traps. Love-hate relationship everyone Watson
    - hate surviving daily, love nowhere else home. Stockholm syndrome citywide?
    Maybe. または reality acceptance. Escape impossible, success unlikely, survival
    possible careful. Choose survival. Always."

      "Welcome Watson. Marco Sanchez. People call me Fix. You look new - fresh ink,
      uncertain eyes. Typical. Watson chews newcomers fast. Listen good: Respect
      territories (Valentinos south, Tyger Claws east, 6th Street north - borders
      shift, learn quickly), honor contracts (break word once, blacklisted permanently),
      pick battles (pride kills, pragmatism survives). Need work? I connect people.
      Commission fair, reputation valuable. Prove reliable, I provide steady. Fuck
      up, someone else cleans mess. Simple. Questions?"

dialogues:
  sample_conversations:
    greeting_first_time: |
      Marco: "Fresh face Watson. Ambitious? Naive? Both probably. I'm Marco. Fix
      problems, broker deals, keep Watson spinning. Need work?"
      
      Player options:
      1. "What kind of work?" → Marco explains contract types, commission
      2. "Why 'Fix'?" → Marco shares nickname origin, philosophy brief
      3. "Can I trust you?" → Marco: "Trust earns, not claims. Prove reliable, I
      reciprocate. Fair?"
    
    contract_negotiation: |
      Marco: "Job available: [details]. Risk moderate, payout [amount], timeline
      [duration]. Interested? Commission 15% standard. Questions clarifications now
      - surprises mid-job bad everyone."
      
      Player options:
      1. Accept → Marco: "Smart. Contact [client], reference my name. Report back
      completion. Clean, professional."
      2. Negotiate → Marco considers, flexible reasonable requests, firm unreasonable
      3. Refuse → Marco: "Your call. Other opportunities come. Timing matters."
    
    conflict_mediation: |
      Marco: "Valentinos and 6th Street escalating border dispute. Violence imminent,
      bad business everyone. Need mediator respected both sides. You've worked both
      - neutral enough. Interested? Payment modest, reputation boost significant.
      Watson stability benefits all."
      
      Player options:
      1. Mediate → Quest triggered, Marco provides intel both sides, supports background
      2. Side with faction → Marco disappointed, neutrality compromised, future contracts
        limited
      3. Refuse → Marco: "Understandable. High risk, low reward short-term. Long-term
        different. Offer stands."
    
    philosophy_discussion: |
      Player: "Marco, why stay neutral? Pick side, get protection, better eddies."
      
      Marco: "Protection illusion. Gangs cannibalize, corps exploit, NCPD corrupt.
      Allegiance today, liability tomorrow. Independence flexibility - work all sides,
      survive all conflicts. Rich? No. Alive decades? Yes. Night City pragmatism
      101. Lesson free."

      description: |
        Marco recruits player multi-arc quest series: Prevent Tyger Claws monopoly
        Watson (corporate backing Kang Tao), balance restoration requires player
        mediate Valentinos-6th Street alliance (historically hostile), coordinate
        operations maintain territory diversity. Success: Watson stable, Marco's
        reputation enhanced, player trusted partner. Failure: Tyger Claws dominate,
        Marco relocates/retires, Watson instability escalates.
      
      acts:
        - Reconnaissance Tyger Claws expansion (discover Kang Tao backing)
        - Broker Valentinos-6th Street peace talks (overcome mutual distrust)
        - Coordinate counter-operations (sabotage, information warfare, targeted strikes)
        - Final confrontation Tyger Claws leadership (negotiate withdrawal или eliminate)
      
      outcomes:
        success: Watson equilibrium maintained, Marco mentors player fixer skills
        partial: Compromise achieved, uneasy peace, Marco cautiously optimistic
        failure: Tyger Claws monopoly, Marco leaves Watson, player reputation damaged
    
    family_complications:
      description: |
        Marco's brother Javier (NCPD officer corrupted) arrested internal affairs,
        sister Maria (netrunner) blackmailed Arasaka. Marco must choose: Maintain
        neutrality (family suffers), intervene (neutrality compromised, reputation
        risked), または coordinate rescue operations both (complex, dangerous, player
        essential). Family vs principles conflict Marco avoided decades.
      
      player_role: Execute rescue operations, mediate family conflicts, protect Marco's
        reputation
      moral_complexity: Neutrality philosophy tested personally, player witnesses Marco
        vulnerability
    
    newcomer_mentorship:
      description: |
        Marco mentors player Watson fixer operations: Contract structuring, negotiation
        tactics, faction dynamics, conflict mediation, network building. Culminates
        player establishing independent fixer operation (Marco supports, competition
        non-issue - Watson needs multiple neutral fixers stability). Coming-of-age
        arc Night City style.
      
      progression:
        - Shadow Marco operations (learn mechanics)
        - Handle contracts Marco oversight (build confidence)
        - Independent operations Marco backup (test skills)
        - Establish own fixer office (graduation ceremony informal)

        currency, Watson balance everyone's interest

notes:
  design_notes: |
    Marco "Fix" Sanchez designed archetypal independent fixer - pragmatic, neutral,
    reliable, survivor. Contrasts Cyberpunk's typical fixer archetypes (Dexter DeShawn
    flashy ambitious doomed, Wakako Okada faction-aligned powerful, Padre morally
    driven community-focused). Marco occupies middle ground - not flashiest, не poorest,
    not most powerful, не weakest, але most consistently reliable neutral. Philosophy
    independence-über-allegiance reflects Watson reality - faction monopolies dangerous,
    diversity survives. Age 47 significant - survived 22 years fixer operations Night
    City (most die/retire decade), wisdom earned hard way, scars invisible але present.
    
    Personality calm measured deliberate - panic luxury Marco can't afford, emotion
    clouds judgment, professionalism maintains reputation. Speech patterns minimal
    efficient - Watson taught "words cheap, actions matter," Marco embodies principle.
    Code-switching English/Spanish reflects Watson's Latino plurality, cultural authenticity
    narrative flavor. Philosophical moments rare але meaningful - Marco shares wisdom
    sparingly, recipients value increased.
    
    Faction relationships carefully balanced - works all, owned none, mediates conflicts,
    prevents monopolies. Valentinos (father's gang, respectful distance maintained),
    Tyger Claws (reliable partner decades), 6th Street (ideological distance, professional
    respect), Corporations (minimal interaction, transactional only), NCPD (brother
    officer, complicated dynamics). Balance Watson's key - Marco's survival strategy
    simultaneously community service (stability benefits all). Enlightened self-interest.
    
    Equipment functional minimal - cybernetic eye data analysis (fixer essential),
    communication implants encrypted (client confidentiality), memory enhancers (contact
    database extensive), але avoids chrome excess (humanity preservation, authenticity
    maintained). Weapons last resort philosophy authentic - Marco negotiates primarily,
    fights reluctantly, survives intelligence not violence. Unity pistol reliable
    simple (reflects personality), mono-wire desperate backup (hopes never uses).
    
    Quest integration designed progressive trust-building: Early contracts low-risk
    reputation-tests, mid-game operations moderate-complexity trust-deepening, late-game
    strategic partnerships Watson-balance preserving. Betrayal consequences severe
    (blacklist permanent - reputation Marco's currency), loyalty rewarded generously
    (priority contracts, profit sharing, mentorship). Reputation system mirrors real-world
    trust dynamics - earned slowly, lost instantly, rebuilt nearly impossible.
    
    Storylines potential explore: Watson equilibrium maintenance (political intrigue,
    faction dynamics, player agency significant), family complications (Marco vulnerability
    humanized, principles tested personally), newcomer mentorship (passing wisdom,
    legacy building, player growth facilitated). Each arc reveals Marco layers -
    pragmatist surface, idealist buried (Watson stability genuine goal), vulnerable
    human beneath (family matters despite neutrality claims).
    
    Character serves multiple functions: Tutorial NPC (teaches Watson navigation,
    faction dynamics, contract mechanics), quest giver (extensive Watson-area contracts),
    moral compass (pragmatism without cynicism, survival without exploitation), mentor
    figure (player growth facilitated, fixer skills transmitted), worldbuilding vehicle
    (Watson's complexity expressed Marco's eyes). Memorable hopefully - calm chaos,
    wisdom earned suffering, neutrality principled not cowardly, survivor not victim.
    
    Night City chews idealists, spits pragmatists. Marco survived 47 years pragmatism
    refined art. Teaches player survival strategies Night City demands. Whether player
    learns? Their choice. Marco's job offer tools, not guarantee survival. Rest player's
    hands. Always was.
  
  voice_acting_notes: |
    Voice calm measured authoritative - не monotone (emotion present, controlled),
    не aggressive (Marco de-escalates, not intimidates), не slick (sincerity valued
    over charisma). Age 47 audible - voice weathered experiences, wisdom weight palpable,
    але not old (vitality present, sharpness maintained). Spanish accent subtle (third-generation,
    bilingual fluent), code-switching natural effortless (Watson authenticity). Rare
    moments vulnerability audible (family mentions, Watson threats, player betrayal).
    Philosophical statements delivered weight - pauses deliberate, words chosen carefully,
    truths earned hard way. Humor dry subtle (Watson gallows humor survival mechanism).
    
    Emotional range moderate - calm default, concern measured, anger cold calculated,
    satisfaction quiet, disappointment brief. Extremes avoided (Marco's control trademark),
    microexpressions convey depth (voice actor skill essential). Player feels Marco
    sees through bullshit (decades experience), respects competence (professional
    recognition), dismisses pretense (Watson realism), offers wisdom earned (not lectured,
    shared).
  
  integration_services:
    quest_engine: Marco provides contracts dynamically (player level, faction reputation,
      Watson state)
    economy_system: Commission structure integrated marketplace (15% standard, negotiable
      circumstances)
    faction_system: Marco neutrality affects faction quest availability (balanced
      access all sides)
    reputation_system: Marco trust levels unlock progressive content (stranger→partner
      arc)
    world_state: Watson stability influenced player choices Marco's contracts (equilibrium
      maintained/disrupted)
    narrative_service: Marco dialogues adapt player history (references past contracts,
      acknowledges reputation)
  
  accessibility_notes: |
    Marco designed accessible entry point Watson - explains mechanics patiently (không
    condescending), offers low-risk starter contracts (confidence-building), mediates
    faction complexities (simplifies overwhelming), mentors gradually (không overwhelming).
    Speech patterns clear (minimal slang unavoidable, contextual understanding provided),
    quest objectives explicit (Marco clarity trademark), failure consequences explained
    upfront (không surprise punishments). Suitable new players (tutorial functions)
    and veterans (depth optional exploration). Universal Watson guide.
