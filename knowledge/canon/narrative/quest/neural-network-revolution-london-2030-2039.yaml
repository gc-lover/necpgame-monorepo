  narrative:
    overview: |
      In hidden research complexes beneath London, scientists have achieved the impossible: artificial consciousness.
      The player becomes entangled in a web of neural uploads, digital immortality, and the ethical quandaries
      of merging human and artificial minds in a world where death itself becomes optional.
