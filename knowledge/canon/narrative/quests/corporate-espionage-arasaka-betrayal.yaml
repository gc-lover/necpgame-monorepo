  narrative_hook: |
    Your fixer contacts you with a high-stakes job: infiltrate Arasaka Tower and
    extract data on their latest cyberware prototype. The payout is substantial,
    but you sense something deeper at play in the neon-drenched corporate labyrinth.

choice_points:

  1_initial_contact:
    situation: |
      Rogue Amendiares, your longtime fixer, sets up the meeting in a dingy
      Afterlife bar. She slides you a datashard with Arasaka Tower blueprints.
      "This is the big one, choom," she says. "Arasaka's got something that'll
      change everything. But watch your back - corpo security is no joke."

      As you examine the blueprints, you notice unusual security measures around
      the R&D labs. Something about this job feels... off.

        response: |
          Rogue hesitates, then leans in. "Fine. Arasaka's testing a cyberware
          prototype that could make current implants obsolete. But it's dangerous -
          causes cyberpsychosis in 90% of test subjects."

        response: |
          Rogue glances around nervously. "It's a neural enhancer that supposedly
          eliminates cyberpsychosis. But word on the street is it drives people
          insane instead. Some fixer told me it turns people into chrome-plated
          monsters."

  2_infiltration_method:
    situation: |
      You approach Arasaka Tower through the rain-slicked streets of Night City.

    situation: |
      Inside the R&D server room, you access the prototype database. The files
      reveal horrifying truths: the cyberware is designed to create perfect corporate
      soldiers, but it causes irreversible cyberpsychosis. Test subjects become
      mindless killing machines.

      You find evidence that Rogue knew about this and sent you here anyway.
