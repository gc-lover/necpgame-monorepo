  narrative:
    overview: |
      In a Berlin where corporate design prioritizes profit over people, a new Bauhaus collective has emerged in abandoned
      factories and digital workshops. Following the original "form follows function" principle, these cyber designers
      create technology that serves human needs rather than corporate greed, blending Bauhaus aesthetics with neural interfaces.

    key_elements:
      - Bauhaus design philosophy in cyberpunk context
      - Human-centered technological design
      - Corporate design industry opposition
      - Functional beauty in utilitarian technology
      - Design education and mentorship
