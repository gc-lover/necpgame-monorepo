quest_overview:
  summary: |
    Investigate a series of cyberpsychosis outbreaks linked to experimental
    cyberware implants. Your journey will force you to confront the thin line

    for power, survival, and identity.

  objectives:
    primary: "Investigate and stop the cyberpsychosis outbreak"
    secondary:
      - "Determine the source of the dangerous cyberware"
      - "Make choices about your own augmentation"
      - "Help or harm affected victims"

  themes:
    - "Humanity vs technological enhancement"
    - "The ethics of cybernetic modification"
    - "Addiction and loss of self"
    - "The cost of power"

  narrative_hook: |
    Night City is descending into chaos. Reports of cyberpsychos - people driven
    insane by their implants - are multiplying. A mysterious fixer approaches
    you with evidence that a new cyberware strain is causing the outbreaks.
    But as you investigate, you begin to wonder: how much chrome have you
    already sacrificed for your own augmentations?
