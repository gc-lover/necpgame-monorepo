  narrative:
    overview: 'The Habsburg Empire once ruled half of Europe, its legacy shaping the continent for centuries. But in the shadows of Vienna''s imperial palaces lies a conspiracy that could bring the dynasty back from the dead.

    The player becomes entangled in a web of neural monarchs, corporate imperial monopolies, and the ultimate question: can a resurrected empire save or destroy modern Europe?

    As corporations and nations battle for control of Habsburg resurrection technology, the fate of European civilization hangs in the balance.'
