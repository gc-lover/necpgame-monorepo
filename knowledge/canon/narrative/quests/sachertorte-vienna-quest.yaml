  theme: culinary_conspiracy
  tone: indulgent
  atmosphere: opulent hotel lobbies, chocolate-scented labs, neural tasting chambers, decadent luxury mixed with corporate sterility
  narrative:
    overview: 'The Hotel Sacher stands as Vienna''s culinary crown jewel, home to the original Sachertorte recipe that has delighted emperors and commoners for centuries. But beneath the marble counters and crystal chandeliers lies a conspiracy that could redefine what it means to taste pleasure.

    The player becomes entangled in a web of corporate chocolate monopolies, neural flavor enhancement, and the age-old question: can artificial bliss rival the perfection of traditional Austrian baking?

    As corporations battle for control of gastronomic neural technology, the fate of human culinary pleasure hangs in the balance.'
