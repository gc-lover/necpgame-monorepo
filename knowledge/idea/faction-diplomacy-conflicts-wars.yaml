## Balance Considerations

### War Frequency Control
- **Cooldown Periods**: Minimum time between major conflicts
- **Escalation Requirements**: Multiple triggers needed for war
- **Peace Incentives**: Economic bonuses for maintaining peace

### Player Agency Limits
- **Personal Actions**: Individual players can't start wars alone
- **Diplomatic Channels**: Peace negotiations always available
- **Consequence Magnitude**: Player actions have proportional impacts

### Performance Optimization
- **War Simulation**: <200ms per global war tick
- **Territory Updates**: <50ms per zone change
- **Player Notifications**: Real-time conflict status updates
- **Memory Usage**: <500KB per active war instance
