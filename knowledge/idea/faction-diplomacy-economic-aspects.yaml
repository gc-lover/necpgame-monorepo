# Faction Diplomacy Economic Aspects

## Overview
Экономика - фундамент дипломатии фракций. Торговые отношения, финансовые инструменты и экономические войны формируют основу всех альянсов и конфликтов в Night City.

## Economic Instruments

### Financial Weapons

#### Economic Sanctions
```
Implementation:
- Tariff impositions (15-50% markup)
- Trade embargoes (complete restrictions)
- Asset freezes (credit account lockdowns)
- Investment bans (no new capital flows)

Economic Impact:
- Revenue reduction: 20-40% for targeted faction
- Supply chain disruption: delayed deliveries
- Market access loss: alternative sourcing costs
- Currency devaluation: 10-25% exchange rate drop

Recovery Mechanisms:
- Black market circumvention (+200% cost premium)
- Alternative trading partners (reduced efficiency)
- Domestic production ramp-up (capital investment required)
- Diplomatic pressure relief (sanction easing)
```

#### Currency Manipulation
```
Tools Available:
- Central bank interventions (artificial rate changes)
- Market speculation campaigns (coordinated selling/buying)
- Digital currency attacks (blockchain manipulation)
- Counterfeit injection (undercut legitimate currency)

Market Effects:
- Exchange rate volatility: ±30% daily fluctuations
- Import/export cost changes: 15-40% variance
- Investment attractiveness: altered risk profiles
- Inflation/deflation spirals: economic destabilization

Player Opportunities:
- Currency arbitrage trading
- Speculative position taking
- Hedging contract offerings
- Black market exchange operations
```

#### Corporate Takeovers
```
Hostile Acquisition Process:
1. Share accumulation (stealth buying)
2. Proxy fight preparation (board seat contests)
3. Tender offer announcement (public bid)
4. Shareholder vote manipulation (bribery campaigns)

Economic Consequences:
- Market capitalization shifts
- Management team changes
- Strategic direction alterations
- Employee displacement effects

Defense Mechanisms:
- Poison pill strategies (anti-takeover provisions)
- White knight alliances (friendly acquisition offers)
- Golden parachute agreements (executive compensation)
- Regulatory intervention requests (government protection)
```
