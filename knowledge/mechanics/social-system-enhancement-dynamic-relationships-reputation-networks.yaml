# Social System Enhancement: Dynamic Relationships & Reputation Networks

# Issue: #2221

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive social system for the cyberpunk MMOFPS RPG, featuring dynamic relationships, reputation networks, and social mechanics that create living, breathing world where player actions have lasting consequences.

## Core Philosophy
- **Living World**: NPCs remember, react, and evolve based on player actions
- **Consequence-Driven**: Every social interaction ripples through the network
- **Dynamic Alliances**: Relationships form and break based on events and choices
- **Reputation Currency**: Social capital becomes as valuable as credits

## Dynamic Relationship System

### Relationship Architecture
```yaml
relationship_system:
  relationship_types:
    - personal: individual NPC relationships
    - faction: group/corporate affiliations
    - community: neighborhood/district standing
    - global: city-wide reputation

  relationship_states:
    - hostile: -100 to -50
    - distrustful: -49 to -10
    - neutral: -9 to 9
    - friendly: 10 to 49
    - allied: 50 to 100

  decay_mechanics:
    - time_decay: relationships naturally fade without interaction
    - event_decay: major events can rapidly change standing
    - maintenance: periodic interactions required to sustain relationships
```

### NPC Personality Matrix
```yaml
npc_personalities:
  - loyalist:
      traits: reliable, trustworthy, conservative
      relationships: stable, predictable changes
      triggers: betrayal highly damaging

  - opportunist:
      traits: flexible, self-serving, adaptive
      relationships: volatile, opportunity-driven
      triggers: personal gain motivates changes

  - idealist:
      traits: principled, passionate, uncompromising
      relationships: extreme, black-and-white
      triggers: moral choices heavily weighted

  - survivor:
      traits: pragmatic, cautious, self-preserving
      relationships: gradual, risk-averse
      triggers: threats and security concerns
```

## Reputation Network Mechanics

### Network Propagation
```yaml
reputation_network:
  propagation_rules:
    - direct_actions: immediate reputation changes
    - witness_testimony: secondary reputation through observers
    - news_reports: media amplification of major events
    - social_sharing: digital reputation spreads through networks

  network_effects:
    - information_speed: reputation changes spread at different rates
    - credibility_decay: distant reports lose accuracy
    - counter_narratives: opposing factions can dispute reputation
    - memory_duration: how long reputation events persist
```

### Multi-Faction Reputation
```yaml
faction_reputation:
  corporate_factions:
    - arasaka: military-industrial, hierarchical
    - militech: aggressive, expansionist
    - biotechnica: scientific, ethical gray areas
    - trauma_team: medical, humanitarian

  street_factions:
    - maelstrom: cybernetic extremists
    - valentinos: traditional crime family
    - animals: eco-terrorists
    - voodoo_boys: net mystics

  reputation_conflicts:
    - allied_factions: helping one hurts relationships with rivals
    - neutral_zones: some areas remain faction-neutral
    - reputation_trading: exchange standing between factions
```

## Social Interaction Mechanics

### Conversation System
```yaml
conversation_mechanics:
  dialogue_options:
    - aggressive: high risk, high reward
    - diplomatic: safe, moderate gains
    - manipulative: high skill requirement, variable outcomes
    - honest: builds long-term trust

  conversation_outcomes:
    - immediate_effects: relationship changes
    - hidden_agendas: NPCs may have secret motivations
    - branching_paths: conversations lead to different opportunities
    - social_combos: multiple conversations create synergy effects
```

### Social Combat System
```yaml
social_combat:
  verbal_duels:
    - intimidation: force compliance through fear
    - persuasion: convince through logic and charisma
    - deception: manipulate through lies and misdirection
    - inspiration: motivate through vision and passion

  social_weapons:
    - blackmail: use compromising information
    - bribery: offer incentives for cooperation
    - favors: trade social capital
    - threats: leverage power imbalances
```

## Dynamic World Events

### Relationship-Driven Events
```yaml
dynamic_events:
  - betrayal_events: trusted allies turn based on circumstances

  event_triggers:
    - time_based: events occur on schedules
    - action_based: player behavior triggers events

    - relationship_queries: <5ms average response
    - reputation_updates: <10ms for complex changes
    - network_calculations: <50ms for large networks
    - memory_usage: <100MB for social state per player
