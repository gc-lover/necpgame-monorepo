  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Unified Combat Systems Wave 1 API for MMOFPS RPG.

    ## Wave 1 Components
    - Combat Sessions: Core session management and lifecycle
    - AI Systems: Enemy profiles, behavior, and coordination
    - Abilities: Player skills and activation system
    - Shooting: Advanced ballistic and weapon systems
    - Combos: Synergy systems and combo mechanics
    - Freerun: Parkour and movement mechanics
    - Hacking: Cybernetic enhancement and countermeasures
    - Stealth: Infiltration and detection systems
    - Extraction: Mission completion and reward systems
    - Arena: PvP combat arenas
    - Cyberspace: Digital realm interactions

    ## Architecture Overview
    - Server-authoritative combat system with client prediction
    - Event-driven architecture with Kafka integration
    - Realtime state synchronization via WebSocket
    - Integrated anti-cheat validation and telemetry

    ## Performance Requirements
    - Session management: 500+ RPS with P99 <50ms
    - Action processing: 1000+ RPS with P99 <25ms
    - Memory optimized with struct alignment
    - Context timeouts on all operations
    - Zero allocations on hot paths

    ## API Structure
    This API is split into multiple files for better maintainability:
    - `combat-sessions.yaml` - Session management
    - `ai-systems.yaml` - AI behavior
    - `abilities.yaml` - Player abilities
    - `shooting.yaml` - Weapon systems
    - `combos.yaml` - Combo mechanics
    - `freerun.yaml` - Parkour movement
    - `hacking.yaml` - Cybernetic systems
    - `stealth.yaml` - Infiltration mechanics
    - `extraction.yaml` - Mission completion
    - `arena.yaml` - PvP combat
    - `cyberspace.yaml` - Digital realm
    - `common-schemas.yaml` - Shared components
