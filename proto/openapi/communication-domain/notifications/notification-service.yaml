  title: Notification Service API
  description: |
    Real-time notification system for MMOFPS RPG.

    Handles in-game notifications, player communications, achievements, and system alerts.

    **BACKEND NOTE**: WebSocket connections require worker pool. Expected load: 10k concurrent connections.
    Memory per notification: ~256 bytes, cached notifications expire after 24h.

    **PERFORMANCE**: Pagination required for notification history, use Redis for caching.
    Expected throughput: 5k notifications/second during peak hours.

    **SCALING**: Horizontal scaling with event-driven architecture via Event Bus.
    WebSocket connections distributed across multiple service instances.
