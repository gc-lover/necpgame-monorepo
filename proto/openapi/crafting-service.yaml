    Crafting Service API for MMOFPS RPG - Production and Manufacturing Systems.

    ## Core Components
    - Recipe System: Hierarchical recipes with materials and requirements
    - Crafting Orders: Async production with quality modifiers
    - Station System: Workstations with efficiency bonuses
    - Production Chains: Multi-stage manufacturing processes

    ## Architecture Overview
    - Async processing with Redis queues
    - Recipe validation and material consumption
    - Quality calculation with modifiers
    - Event-driven production completion

    ## Performance Requirements
    - Recipe queries: 1000+ RPS with P99 <50ms
    - Order operations: 200+ RPS with P99 <100ms
    - Station queries: 500+ RPS with P99 <50ms
    - Memory optimized with object pooling
