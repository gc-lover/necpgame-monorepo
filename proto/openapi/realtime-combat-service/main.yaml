  title: Real-time Combat Service API - Enterprise-Grade Real-time Combat Engine
  description: "**Enterprise-grade API for Real-time Combat Management**

    Complete real-time combat service for NECPGAME MMOFPS RPG. Handles live combat sessions, WebSocket-based real-time updates, position synchronization, damage events, and combat session orchestration with enterprise-grade performance optimizations.

    ## Key Features

    - **Enterprise-grade architecture** with proper domain separation - **Real-time WebSocket support** for 10k+ concurrent connections - **Backend optimization hints** for struct alignment and memory savings - **Event-driven microservice** with Kafka integration - **Anti-cheat validation** and lag compensation algorithms

    ## Domain Purpose

    Manages real-time combat components including session lifecycle, live player synchronization, damage calculations, combat analytics, and spectator systems.

    ## Performance Targets

    - WebSocket connections: 10k+ concurrent, <50MB memory per 1000 connections
    - Position updates: 1000+ updates/sec, P99 <10ms latency
    - Damage events: 2000+ events/sec, <5ms processing time
    - Combat sessions: 500+ active sessions, <20ms state sync
    - Event throughput: 5000+ events/sec via Kafka
    - Cache hit rate: >98% (Redis for active combat states)
