  description: '**Enterprise-Grade Notifications Module** for NECPGAME MMOFPS RPG.


    **Module Purpose:** Complete real-time notification system with WebSocket support, push notifications, and advanced filtering.


    **Architecture:** Event-driven microservice with WebSocket connections and Kafka integration.


    **Core Features:**

    - Real-time WebSocket notifications (10k+ concurrent connections)

    - Push notification support (iOS, Android, Web)

    - Advanced filtering and preferences

    - Notification history and archiving

    - Batch operations for performance

    - Rate limiting and anti-spam protection

    - Multi-channel delivery (in-game, push, email, SMS)


    **Performance Targets:**

    - Hot paths: 1000+ RPS, P99 <50ms (send/receive notifications)

    - WebSocket connections: 10k+ concurrent, <100MB memory per 1000 connections

    - Push notifications: 5000+ per minute, <10s delivery time

    - Cache hit rate: >95% (Redis for active notifications)

    - Message size: <1KB per notification


    **BACKEND NOTE:** Memory per notification: ~256 bytes. WebSocket worker pools required.

    Notification schemas optimized for 30-50% memory savings in generated Go structs.
