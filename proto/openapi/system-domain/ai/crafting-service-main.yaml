    ## Core Components

    - Recipe System: Hierarchical recipes with materials and requirements

    - Crafting Orders: Async production with quality modifiers

    - Station System: Workstations with efficiency bonuses

    - Production Chains: Multi-stage manufacturing processes


    ## Architecture Overview

    - Async processing with Redis queues

    - Recipe validation and material consumption

    - Quality calculation with modifiers

    - Event-driven production completion


    ## Performance Requirements

    - Recipe queries: 1000+ RPS with P99 <50ms

    - Order operations: 200+ RPS with P99 <100ms

    - Station queries: 500+ RPS with P99 <50ms

    - Memory optimized with object pooling
