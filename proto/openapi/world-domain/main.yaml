    Consolidated World Domain API for NECPGAME complete game world and gameplay systems.

    This API consolidates ALL world functionality across the entire platform:
    - Advanced gameplay mechanics and systems (advanced/)
    - City management and urban environments (cities/)
    - Real-time combat and battle systems (combat/)
    - Continent exploration and management (continents/)
    - World events and dynamic occurrences (events/)
    - Planetary systems and cosmic environments (planets/)
    - Political systems and faction influence (politics/)
    - Real-time synchronization and state management (sync/)
    - Core world systems and utilities (core/)

    All endpoints are organized into logical modules with $ref references.
