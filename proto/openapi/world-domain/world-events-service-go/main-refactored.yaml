  description: |
    **Enterprise-Grade World Events Service API** for NECPGAME MMOFPS RPG.

    **Enterprise-Grade Domain:** world-domain
    **Module:** world-events-service-go
    **Purpose:** Dynamic world event management and player engagement

    **BACKEND NOTE:** Struct field alignment optimized (large → small types).
    All schemas ordered for optimal memory layout in generated Go code.
    Expected memory savings: 30-50% for event-related structs.
    Hot paths: /events/active, /events/{eventId}/status, /events/participate
    Expected RPS: 1000+ for hot paths, zero allocations.

    **Architecture:** Service split into specialized modules for better maintainability.

    **Core Features:**
    - Dynamic world event creation and management
    - Real-time event participation and tracking
    - Event-based quests and objectives
    - World state synchronization across players
    - Event rewards and achievements
    - Cross-region event coordination
    - Anti-cheat validation for event participation

    **Performance Targets:**
    - Hot paths: 1000+ RPS, P99 <15ms
    - Memory per event: <10MB
    - Cache hit rate: >95%
    - Event throughput: 200+ events/sec
