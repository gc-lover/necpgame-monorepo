  title: Cyber Space Simulator Service API
  description: '**Enterprise-grade API for Cyber Space Simulator Service**


    ## Domain Purpose

    Digital reality engine managing cyberspace missions, ICE combat systems,

    data manipulation frameworks, and consciousness transfer mechanics.


    ## Performance Targets

    - P99 Latency: <25ms for all endpoints (ultra-low latency requirement)

    - Memory per Mission: <200MB baseline

    - ICE Entities per Mission: 1000+ supported simultaneously

    - Consciousness Transfers: 100+ concurrent

    - Uptime: 99.9% SLA


    ## Domain Inheritance

    This service inherits from game-entities.yaml providing:

    - Consistent base entity structure (id, timestamps, version) - НЕ ДУБЛИРУЕМ!

    - Game-specific business entities (Player, Character, etc.)

    - Optimistic locking for concurrent operations

    - Strict typing with validation rules


    ## Architecture Patterns

    - Digital Reality Simulator with event-driven architecture

    - Real-time synchronization (<25ms P99 target)

    - Network topology generation and management

    - ICE combat resolution with quantum-like processing

        **Performance Notes:**

        - Uses spatial indexes for network topology filtering

        - Ultra-low latency required (<25ms P99)

        - Real-time mission state updates
