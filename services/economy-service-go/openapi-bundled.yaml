  description: |-
    **Enterprise-Grade Economy Service API for NECPGAME MMOFPS RPG.
    **Service Purpose:** Complete economy and trading system with market analysis, trade management, and transaction history.
    **Architecture:** Event-driven microservice with Kafka integration for trade events and market updates.
    **Domain:** economy-service
    **Core Features:** - Trade listing and management - Market overview and analytics - Transaction history tracking - Player economy statistics - Anti-fraud trade validation
    **Performance Targets:** - Hot paths: 500+ RPS, P99 <25ms (trade operations) - Market data: 2000+ RPS, P99 <15ms (market overview) - Memory: <40MB per service instance (optimized structs) - Cache hit rate: >90% (Redis for market data)
    **BACKEND NOTE:** Struct field alignment optimized (large → small types). All schemas ordered for optimal memory layout in generated Go code. Expected memory savings: 30-50% for economy-related structs.
    **Security:** JWT authentication with role-based trade permissions.
