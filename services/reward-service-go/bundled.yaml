  title: Reward Service API - Enterprise-Grade Domain Service
  description: '**Enterprise-Grade Reward and Achievement System API for NECPGAME**

    This API manages player rewards, achievements, incentives, and reward distribution
    across all game systems in the cyberpunk world of Night City.

    ## Key Features

    - **Reward Management**: Dynamic reward creation and distribution - **Achievement
    System**: Complex achievement tracking and unlocking - **Incentive Programs**:
    Time-limited events and special rewards - **Reward Analytics**: Tracking reward
    effectiveness and player engagement - **Fair Distribution**: Anti-cheat measures
    and fair reward allocation - **Performance Optimized**: High-throughput reward
    processing with <30ms P99 latency

    ## Domain Purpose

    The Reward domain drives player engagement and retention through meaningful achievements
    and rewards. Players earn rewards through gameplay, achievements, events, and
    community participation, creating compelling progression loops.

    ## Performance Targets

    - P99 Latency: <30ms for reward operations - Memory: <25KB per active reward session
    - Concurrent users: 150,000+ simultaneous reward distributions - Achievement checks:
    <15ms response time
