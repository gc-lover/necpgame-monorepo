  title: Social Intrigue Processor Service API
  description: '**Enterprise-grade API for Social Intrigue Processor Service**


    ## Domain Purpose

    Advanced social simulation engine managing complex NPC relationships,

    branching dialogue systems, conspiracy networks, and long-term consequence tracking.


    ## Performance Targets

    - P99 Latency: <50ms for all endpoints

    - Memory per Relationship Graph: <150MB baseline

    - Concurrent Social Interactions: 5000+ supported

    - Relationship Graph Nodes: 100,000+ per shard

    - Uptime: 99.9% SLA


    ## Domain Inheritance

    This service inherits from game-entities.yaml providing:

    - Consistent base entity structure (id, timestamps, version) - НЕ ДУБЛИРУЕМ!

    - Game-specific business entities (Character, NPC, etc.)

    - Optimistic locking for concurrent operations

    - Strict typing with validation rules


    ## Architecture Patterns

    - Relationship Graph Engine with player-sharded storage

    - Dialogue State Machine with branching conversations

    - Event-Sourced social consequence tracking

    - Real-time relationship synchronization

        **Performance Notes:**

        - Uses graph database indexes for efficient relationship queries

        - Implements cursor-based pagination for large relationship graphs

        - Response cached for 30 seconds (relationships update frequently)
