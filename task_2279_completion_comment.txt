[OK] World completed Diplomacy Engine (FreeCiv Logic) implementation in Python

## Task Summary
- **Issue:** #2279 - Implement Diplomacy Engine (FreeCiv Logic) in Python
- **Type:** WORLD (Simulation Engine)
- **Status:** COMPLETED ✅

## Major Deliverables
- ✅ **Enterprise-Grade Diplomacy Engine**: `services/world-simulation-python/diplomacy_engine.py`
- ✅ **FreeCiv Logic Implementation**: Love/Fear based diplomatic relations between factions
- ✅ **Complete State Management**: Faction states, relations, treaties, and event handling
- ✅ **Event-Driven Integration**: Ready for `world.tick.daily` Kafka events
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests demonstrating correct state transitions

## Key Features Implemented
- **Faction State Management**: Military power, economic strength, territory, technology, morale
- **Diplomatic Relations**: Love (-1.0 to 1.0) and Fear (0.0 to 1.0) scoring system
- **State Transitions**: WAR, PEACE, ALLIANCE, COLD_WAR based on Love/Fear calculations
- **Treaty System**: Alliance, trade agreements, non-aggression pacts with expiration
- **Event Processing**: War declarations, alliances, betrayals affecting relations
- **Time Evolution**: Trust recovery and gradual diplomatic changes over time

## Technical Specifications
- **Algorithm**: Score = Love + Fear_Impact - Hate_Impact + Random_Noise
- **State Thresholds**: WAR (< -0.7), COLD_WAR (-0.7 to -0.3), ALLIANCE (> 0.5)
- **Integration**: Kafka consumer for daily ticks, event publishing to simulation.event
- **Performance**: O(n²) complexity for n factions, suitable for <100 factions
- **Enterprise Features**: Structured logging, error handling, configuration management

## Validation Results
✅ **All Requirements Met**:
- Python module with `evaluate_relations` function implemented
- Unit tests showing correct state transition (WAR when Low Love + High Power Diff)
- Love/Fear metrics properly calculating diplomatic scores
- Event-driven execution ready for daily tick processing
- Enterprise-grade error handling and logging

**Ready for QA testing and production deployment. Handed off to QA agent.**
