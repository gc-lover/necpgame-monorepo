[OK] Ready. Handed off to QA Agent.

**Issue Status:** COMPLETED by Backend Agent

**Work Completed:**
1. ✅ Fixed package conflicts - removed duplicate OpenAPI files from root directory
2. ✅ Created repository adapter (SupportRepositoryAdapter) for proper interface implementation
3. ✅ Created security adapter (SecurityAdapter) to implement api.SecurityHandler interface
4. ✅ Fixed model field names (PlayerID → CharacterID) across all repository files
5. ✅ Updated SQL queries to use correct column names (character_id)
6. ✅ Fixed HTTP server implementation using standard http.Server with API server as handler
7. ✅ Service now compiles successfully and starts without errors
8. ✅ All OpenAPI handlers properly implemented with error handling
9. ✅ Business logic fully implemented in service layer
10. ✅ Repository layer with PostgreSQL support (adapter pattern)

**Technical Details:**
- Service uses pgx driver for PostgreSQL connections
- Implements JWT-based authentication middleware
- Full CRUD operations for support tickets
- SLA monitoring and agent queue management
- Pagination support for all list endpoints
- Proper error handling and logging with Zap

**Next Steps:** QA Agent should perform integration testing and validation.
