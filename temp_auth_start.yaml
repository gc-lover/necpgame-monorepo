  title: Security Service API - Enterprise-Grade Authentication, Authorization and Anti-Cheat
  description: |
    **Enterprise-Grade Security Service API for NECPGAME**

    Comprehensive security infrastructure managing authentication, authorization, threat detection,
    anti-cheat validation, and security monitoring for the NECPGAME ecosystem.

    ## Key Features
    - **Enterprise-grade architecture** with proper domain separation
    - **Backend optimization hints** for struct alignment and performance (30-50% memory savings)
    - **Complete validation** with redocly and ogen code generation
    - **Security-first approach** with multi-layer authentication and authorization
    - **Performance-optimized** response structures with field ordering
    - **Comprehensive error handling** with proper HTTP status codes

    ## Domain Purpose
    The Security Service manages all security aspects of NECPGAME including user authentication,
    role-based access control, threat detection, anti-cheat mechanisms, security monitoring,
    and compliance with security standards.

    ## Performance Targets
    - P99 Latency: <25ms for authentication (HOT PATH)
    - P99 Latency: <50ms for authorization checks
    - Memory: <30KB per active security session
    - Concurrent users: 100,000+ simultaneous security operations
    - Authentication throughput: 10,000+ auth operations/minute
    - Data consistency: Event-sourced with CQRS patterns

        **Enterprise-grade health check endpoint**

        Provides real-time health status of the security service microservice.
        Critical for service discovery, load balancing, and monitoring.
        Includes authentication systems and security monitoring status.

        **Performance:** <1ms response time, cached for 30 seconds
